Press \\\\[\\\\text{ ENTER} \\\\].\\n\\nWhen you run a program, the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus automatically checks for errors. For example, the following message is displayed if you:\\n- Do not enter ( ) after the program name.\\n- Do not enter enough arguments, if required.\\n\\nTo cancel program execution if an error occurs, press \\\\[\\\\text{ ESC} \\\\]. You can then correct any problems and run the program again.\\n\\n\\u201cBreaking\\u201d a Program\\n\\nWhen a program is running, the BUSY indicator is displayed in the status line.\\n\\nPress \\\\[\\\\text{ CLEAR} \\\\] to stop program execution.

Refer to page 310.\\nWhere Is the Output Displayed?\\n\\nDepending on the commands in the program, the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus automatically displays information on the applicable screen.\\n\\n- Most output and input commands use the Program I/O screen. (Input commands prompt the user to enter information.)\\n- Graph-related commands typically use the Graph screen.\\n\\nAfter the program stops, the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus shows the last screen that was displayed.\\n\\nThe Program I/O Screen\\n\\nOn the Program I/O screen, new output is displayed below any previous output (which may have been displayed earlier in the same program or a different program). After a full page of output, the previous output scrolls off the top of the screen.\\n\\nTip: To clear any previous output, enter the ClrIO command in your program. You can also execute ClrIO from the Home screen.\\n\\nTip: If Home screen calculations don\\u2019t work after you run a program, you may be on the Program I/O screen.\\n\\nLeaving the Program I/O Screen\\n\\nFrom the Program I/O screen:\\n\\n- Press \\u2021 toolbar is available; all others are dimmed.\\n- There is no entry line.\\n\\nWhen a program stops on the Program I/O screen, you need to recognize that it is not the Home screen (although the two screens are similar). The Program I/O screen is used only to display output or to prompt the user for input. You cannot perform calculations on this screen.\\n\\nFrom the Program I/O screen:\\n\\n- Press \\u2021 to toggle between the Home screen and the Program I/O screen.\\n- Press Esc, 2nd [quit], or\\n- TI-89: [EXIT]\\n- TI-92 Plus: [Home]\\nto display the Home screen.\\n\\n- Display any other application screen (with [APPS], [Y=], etc.).\\nStarting a Program Editor Session\\n\\n1. Press APPS and then select 7:Program Editor.\\n2. Select 3:New.\\n3. Specify the applicable information for the new program or function.\\n\\n| Item    | Lets you:                                  |\\n|---------|-------------------------------------------|\\n| Type    | Select whether to create a new program or function. |\\n| Folder  | Select the folder in which the new program or function will be stored.

If you specify a variable that already exists, an error message will be displayed when you press \\\\(\\\\text{ENTER}\\\\). When you press \\\\(\\\\text{ESC}\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\text{ENTER}\\\\) to acknowledge the error, the NEW dialog box is redisplayed. |\\n\\n4. Press \\\\(\\\\text{ENTER}\\\\) (after typing in an input box such as Variable, you must press \\\\(\\\\text{ENTER}\\\\) twice) to display an empty \\u201ctemplate.\\u201d\\n\\nNote: A program (or function) is saved automatically as you type. You do not need to save it manually before leaving the Program Editor, starting a new program, or opening a previous one.\\n\\nThis is the template for a program. Functions have a similar template.\\n\\nYou can now use the Program Editor as described in the remaining sections of this chapter.\\nResuming the Current Program\\nYou can leave the Program Editor and go to another application at any time. To return to the program or function that was displayed when you left the Program Editor, press APPS 7 and select 1:Current.\\n\\nStarting a New Program from the Program Editor\\nTo leave the current program or function and start a new one:\\n1. Press [F1] and select 3:New.\\n2. Specify the type, folder, and variable for the new program or function.\\n3. Press [ENTER] twice.\\n\\nOpening a Previous Program\\nYou can open a previously created program or function at any time.\\n1. From within the Program Editor, press [F1] and select 1:Open.\\n2. Select the applicable type, folder, and variable.\\n3. Press [ENTER].\\n\\nNote: By default, Variable shows the first existing program or function in alphabetical order.\\n\\nCopying a Program\\nIn some cases, you may want to copy a program or function so that you can edit the copy while retaining the original.\\n1. Display the program or function you want to copy.\\n2. Press [F1] and select 2:Save Copy As.\\n3. Specify the folder and variable for the copy.\\n4. Press [ENTER] twice.\\n\\nNote about Deleting a Program\\nBecause all Program Editor sessions are saved automatically, you can accumulate quite a few previous programs and functions, which take up memory storage space.\\n\\nTo delete programs and functions, use the VAR-LINK screen (2nd [VAR-LINK]). For information about VAR-LINK, refer to Chapter 21.\\nOverview of Entering a Program\\n\\nA program is a series of commands executed in sequential order (although some commands alter the program flow). In general, anything that can be executed from the Home screen can be included in a program. Program execution continues until it reaches the end of the program or a Stop command.\\n\\nEntering and Editing Program Lines\\n\\nOn a blank template, you can begin entering commands for your new program.\\n\\nProgram name, which you specify when you create a new program.\\n\\nNote: Use the cursor pad to scroll through the program for entering or editing commands. Use \\u2021 or \\u2020 to go to the top or bottom of a program, respectively.\\n\\nEnter your program commands between Prgm and EndPrgm.\\n\\nAll program lines begin with a colon.\\n\\nYou enter and edit program commands in the Program Editor by using the same techniques used to enter and edit text in the Text Editor. Refer to \\u201cEntering and Editing Text\\u201d in Chapter 18.\\n\\nAfter typing each program line, press  }. This inserts a new blank line and lets you continue entering another line. A program line can be longer than one line on the screen; if so, it will wrap to the next screen line automatically.\\n\\nEntering Multi-Command Lines\\n\\nTo enter more than one command on the same line, separate them with a colon by pressing  2\\u00c8  .\\n\\nEntering Comments\\n\\nA comment symbol ( \\u00a6 ) lets you enter a remark in a program. When you run the program, all characters to the right of \\u00a6 are ignored.\\n\\nTip: Use comments to enter information that is useful to someone reading the program code.\\n\\nTo enter the comment symbol, press:\\n\\n- TI-89: [ \\u00a6 ]\\n- TI-92 Plus: [ 2\\u00c8 ]\\n\\nor\\n\\n- Press  and select 9: \\u00a6\\n\\nChapter 17: Programming\\nWhen you run a program, the program lines are executed in sequential order. However, some commands alter the program flow. For example:\\n\\n- Control structures such as `If...EndIf` commands use a conditional test to decide which part of a program to execute.\\n- Loops commands such as `For...EndFor` repeat a group of commands.\\n\\n### Using Indentation\\n\\nFor more complex programs that use `If...EndIf` and loop structures such as `For...EndFor`, you can make the programs easier to read and understand by using indentation.\\n\\n```plaintext\\n:If x>5 Then\\n  :Disp \\\"x is > 5\\\"\\n:Else\\n  :Disp \\\"x is < or = 5\\\"\\n:EndIf\\n```\\n\\n### Displaying Calculated Results\\n\\nIn a program, calculated results are not displayed unless you use an output command. This is an important difference between performing a calculation on the Home screen and in a program.\\n\\nThese calculations will not display a result in a program (although they will on the Home screen).\\n\\n```plaintext\\n:12 \\u00f7 6\\n:cos(n/4)\\n:solve(x^2-x-2=0,x)\\n```\\n\\nOutput commands such as `Disp` will display a result in a program.\\n\\n```plaintext\\n:Disp 12 \\u00f7 6\\n:Disp cos(n/4)\\n:Disp solve(x^2-x-2=0,x)\\n```\\n\\nDisplaying a calculation result does not store that result. If you need to refer to a result later, store it to a variable.\\n\\n```plaintext\\n:cos(n/4)*maximum\\n:Disp maximum\\n```\\n\\n### Getting Values into a Program\\n\\nTo input values into a program, you can:\\n\\n- Require the users to store a value (with `STO`) to the necessary variables before running the program. The program can then refer to these variables.\\n- Enter the values directly into the program itself.\\n- Include input commands that prompt the users to enter the necessary values when they run the program.\\n- Require the users to pass one or more values to the program when they run it.\\n\\n```plaintext\\n:Disp 12 \\u00f7 6\\n:Disp cos(n/4)*maximum\\n:Input \\\"Enter a value\\\",i\\n:Request \\\"Enter an integer\\\",n\\n```\\n\\n```plaintext\\n:prog1(3,5)\\n```\\nThe following program draws a circle on the Graph screen and then draws a horizontal line across the top of the circle. Three values must be passed to the program: \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) coordinates for the circle's center and the radius \\\\( r \\\\).\\n\\n- When you write the program in the Program Editor:\\n\\nIn the () beside the program name, specify the variables that will be used to store the passed values.\\n\\nNotice that the program also contains commands that set up the Graph screen.\\n\\n\\ncirc\\\\( (x,y,r) \\\\)\\n\\n:circ\\\\( (x,y,r) \\\\)\\n:Prgm\\n:FnOff\\n:ZoomStd\\n:ZoomSqr\\n:Circle \\\\( x,y,r \\\\)\\n:LineHorz \\\\( y+r \\\\)\\n:EndPrgm\\n\\nBefore drawing the circle, the program turns off any selected \\\\( Y= \\\\) Editor functions, displays a standard viewing window, and \\\"squares\\\" the window.\\n\\n- To run the program from the Home screen:\\n\\nThe user must specify the applicable values as arguments within the ()\\n\\nThe arguments, in order, are passed to the program.\\n\\n\\\\( \\\\text{circ}(0,0,5) \\\\)\\n\\n\\\\( \\\\text{circ}(0,0,5) \\\\)\\n\\nPassed to \\\\( r \\\\).\\n\\nPassed to \\\\( y \\\\).\\n\\nPassed to \\\\( x \\\\).\\nOverview of Entering a Function\\n\\nA function created in the Program Editor is very similar to the functions and instructions that you typically use from the Home screen.\\n\\nWhy Create a User-Defined Function?\\n\\nFunctions (as well as programs) are ideal for repetitive calculations or tasks. You only need to write the function once. Then you can reuse it as many times as necessary. Functions, however, have some advantages over programs.\\n\\n- You can create functions that expand on the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus\\u2019s built-in functions. You can then use the new functions the same as any other function.\\n- Functions return values that can be graphed or entered in a table; programs cannot.\\n- You can use a function (but not a program) within an expression. For example: 3*func1(3) is valid, but not 3*prog1(3).\\n- Because you pass arguments to a function, you can write generic functions that are not tied to specific variable names.\\n\\nDifferences Between Functions and Programs\\n\\nThis guidebook sometimes uses the word command as a generic reference to instructions and functions. When writing a function, however, you must differentiate between instructions and functions.\\n\\nA user-defined function:\\n\\n- Can use the following instructions only. Any others are invalid.\\n  \\n  | Instruction | Definition |\\n  |-------------|------------|\\n  | Cycle       | Define     | Exit       |\\n  | For...EndFor| Goto       | If...EndIf (all forms) |\\n  | Lbl         | Local      | Loop...EndLoop |\\n  | Return      | While...EndWhile |\\n\\n  \\u2022 Can use all built-in TI-89 / TI-92 Plus functions except:\\n    \\n    | Function       | Definition |\\n    |----------------|------------|\\n    | setFold        | setGraph   | setMode    |\\n    | setTable       | switch     |            |\\n\\n  \\u2022 Can refer to any variable; however, it can store a value to a local variable only.\\n    - The arguments used to pass values to a function are treated as local variables automatically. If you store to any other variables, you must declare them as local from within the function.\\n  \\n- Cannot call a program as a subroutine, but it can call another user-defined function.\\n- Cannot define a program.\\n- Cannot define a global function, but it can define a local function.\\n\\nTip: For information about local variables, refer to pages 288 and 290.\\nEntering a Function\\n\\nWhen you create a new function in the Program Editor, the TI-89/TI-92 Plus displays a blank \\u201ctemplate\\u201d.\\n\\nFunction name, which you specify when you create a new function.\\n\\nEnter your commands between Func and EndFunc.\\n\\nAll function lines begin with a colon.\\n\\nNote: Use the cursor pad to scroll through the function for entering or editing commands.\\n\\nHow to Return a Value from a Function\\n\\nThere are two ways to return a value from a function:\\n\\n- As the last line in the function (before EndFunc), calculate the value to be returned.\\n\\n  :cube(x)\\n  :Func\\n  :x^3\\n  :EndFunc\\n\\n- Use Return. This is useful for exiting a function and returning a value at some point other than the end of the function.\\n\\n  :cube(x)\\n  :Func\\n  :If x<0\\n  :  Return 0\\n  :  x^3\\n  :EndFunc\\n\\nThe argument x is automatically treated as a local variable. However, if the example needed another variable, the function would need to declare it as local by using the Local command (pages 288 and 290).\\n\\nThere is an implied Return at the end of the function. If the last line is not an expression, an error occurs.\\n\\nExample of a Function\\n\\nThe following function returns the xth root of a value y \\\\( \\\\sqrt[x]{y} \\\\). Two values must be passed to the function: x and y.\\n\\nFunction as called from the Home Screen      Function as defined in the Program Editor\\n\\n\\\\[ 3 \\\\times x: 125 \\\\times y \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ 4 \\\\times x \\\\sqrt[3]{3,125} \\\\]\\n\\n4xroot(3,125)  20\\n\\n: xroot(x,y)\\n: Func\\n\\n: y^(1/x)\\n: EndFunc\\n\\nNote: Because x and y in the function are local, they are not affected by any existing x or y variable.\\nCalling One Program from Another\\n\\nOne program can call another program as a subroutine. The subroutine can be external (a separate program) or internal (included in the main program). Subroutines are useful when a program needs to repeat the same group of commands at several different places.\\n\\nCalling a Separate Program\\n\\nTo call a separate program, use the same syntax used to run the program from the Home screen.\\n\\n```\\n:subtest1()\\n:Prgm\\n:For i,1,4,1\\n  :subtest2(i,i+1000)\\n:EndFor\\n:EndPrgm\\n```\\n\\nCalling an Internal Subroutine\\n\\nTo define an internal subroutine, use the `Define` command with `Prgm...EndPrgm`. Because a subroutine must be defined before it can be called, it is a good practice to define subroutines at the beginning of the main program.\\n\\nAn internal subroutine is called and executed in the same way as a separate program.\\n\\n```\\n:subtest1()\\n:Prgm\\n:local subtest2\\n:Define subtest2(x,y)=Prgm\\n  :Disp x,y\\n:EndPrgm\\n:EndPrgm\\n```\\n\\nNotes about Using Subroutines\\n\\nAt the end of a subroutine, execution returns to the calling program. To exit a subroutine at any other time, use the `Return` command.\\n\\nA subroutine cannot access local variables declared in the calling program. Likewise, the calling program cannot access local variables declared in a subroutine.\\n\\n`Lbl` commands are local to the programs in which they are located. Therefore, a `Goto` command in the calling program cannot branch to a label in a subroutine or vice versa.\\nUsing Variables in a Program\\n\\nPrograms use variables in the same general way that you use them from the Home screen. However, the \\u201cscope\\u201d of the variables affects how they are stored and accessed.\\n\\n### Scope of Variables\\n\\n| Scope          | Description                                                                 |\\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| System Variables (Global) | Variables with reserved names that are created automatically to store data about the state of the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus. For example, Window variables (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, etc.) are globally available from any folder. |\\n|                | \\u2022 You can always refer to these variables by using the variable name only, regardless of the current folder. |\\n|                | \\u2022 A program cannot create system variables, but it can use the values and (in most cases) store new values. |\\n| Folder Variables | Variables that are stored in a particular folder. |\\n|                | \\u2022 If you store to a variable name only, it is stored in the current folder. For example: 5\\u21d2start |\\n|                | \\u2022 If you refer to a variable name only, that variable must be in the current folder. Otherwise, it cannot be found (even if the variable exists in a different folder). |\\n|                | \\u2022 To store or refer to a variable in another folder, you must specify a path name. For example: 5\\u21d2class/start |\\n\\n**Note:** If a program has local variables, a graphed function cannot access them. For example:\\n\\nLocal a\\n5\\u21d2a\\nGraph a * cos(x) may display an error or an unexpected result (if a is an existing variable in the current folder).\\n\\nAfter the program stops, any folder variables created by the program still exist and still take up memory.\\n\\nLocal Variables\\n\\nTemporary variables that exist only while a program is running. When the program stops, local variables are deleted automatically.\\n\\n\\u2022 To create a local variable in a program, use the Local command to declare the variable.\\n\\u2022 A local variable is treated as unique even if there is an existing folder variable with the same name.\\n\\u2022 Local variables are ideal for temporarily storing values that you do not want to save.\\n\\n288 \\\\ Chapter 17: Programming\\nCircular Definition Errors\\n\\nWhen evaluating a user-defined function or running a program, you can specify an argument that includes the same variable that was used to define the function or create the program. However, to avoid Circular definition errors, you must assign a value for \\\\( x \\\\) or \\\\( i \\\\) variables that are used in evaluating the function or running the program. For example:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\nx+1 & \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{Causes a Circular definition error message if } x \\\\text{ or } i \\\\text{ does not have a value. The error does not occur if } x \\\\text{ or } i \\\\text{ has already been assigned a value.} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{\\u2013 or \\u2013} \\\\quad \\\\text{For } i=1,10,1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{Disp} \\\\ i \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{EndFor}\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n| Command     | Description                                                                 |\\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| \\\\( \\\\text{STO} \\\\) key | Stores a value to a variable. As on the Home screen, pressing \\\\( \\\\text{STO} \\\\) enters a \\\\( \\\\rightarrow \\\\) symbol. |\\n| Archive     | Moves specified variables from RAM to user data archive memory.             |\\n| BldData     | Lets you create a data variable based on the graph information entered in the Y=Editor, Window Editor, etc. |\\n| CopyVar     | Copies the contents of a variable.                                           |\\n| Define      | Defines a program (subroutine) or function variable within a program.       |\\n| DelFold     | Deletes a folder. All variables in that folder must be deleted first.        |\\n| DelVar      | Deletes a variable.                                                         |\\n| getFold     | Returns the name of the current folder.                                      |\\n| getType     | Returns a string that indicates the data type (EXPR, LIST, etc.) of a variable. |\\n| Local       | Declares one or more variables as local variables.                          |\\n| Lock        | Locks a variable so that it cannot be accidentally changed or deleted without first being unlocked. |\\n| MoveVar     | Moves a variable from one folder to another.                                |\\n| NewData     | Creates a data variable whose columns consist of a series of specified lists.|\\n| NewFold     | Creates a new folder.                                                       |\\n| NewPic      | Creates a picture variable based on a matrix.                               |\\n| Rename      | Renames a variable.                                                         |\\n| Unarchiv    | Moves specified variables from user data archive memory to RAM.             |\\n| Unlock      | Unlocks a locked variable.                                                  |\\n\\nNote: The Define, DelVar, and Local commands are available from the Program Editor's \\\\( \\\\text{Var} \\\\) toolbar menu.\\nUsing Local Variables in Functions or Programs\\n\\n**Example of a Local Variable**\\n\\nThe following program segment shows a `For...EndFor` loop (which is discussed later in this chapter). The variable `i` is the loop counter. In most cases, the variable `i` is used only while the program is running.\\n\\n```plaintext\\n:Local i\\n:For i,0,5,1\\n  Disp i\\n:EndFor\\n:Disp i\\n```\\n\\nIf you declare variable `i` as local, it is deleted automatically when the program stops so that it does not use up memory.\\n\\n**What Causes an Undefined Variable Error Message?**\\n\\nAn Undefined variable error message displays when you evaluate a user-defined function or run a user-defined program that references a local variable that is not initialized (assigned a value).\\n\\nThis example is a multi-statement function, rather than a program. Line breaks are shown here, but you would type the text in the entry line as one continuous line, such as:`Define fact(n)=Func:Local...` where the ellipsis indicates the entry line text continues off-screen.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```plaintext\\nDefine fact(n)=Func:\\n  Local m:\\n  While n>1:\\n    n*m=n!:\\n  EndWhile:\\n  Return m:\\nEndFunc\\n```\\n\\nIn the example above, the local variable `m` exists independently of any variable `m` that exists outside of the function.\\n\\n**You Must Initialize Local Variables**\\n\\nAll local variables must be assigned an initial value before they are referenced.\\n\\n```plaintext\\nDefine fact(n)=Func:\\n  Local m: 1 is stored as the initial value for m.\\n  While n>1:\\n    n*m=n!:\\n  EndWhile:\\n  Return m:\\nEndFunc\\n```\\n\\nThe TI-89/TI-92 Plus cannot use a local variable to perform symbolic calculations.\\n\\n---\\n\\nA local variable is a temporary variable that exists only while a user-defined function is being evaluated or a user-defined program is running.\\nIf you want a function or program to perform symbolic calculations, you must use a global variable instead of a local. However, you must be certain that the global variable does not already exist outside of the program. The following methods can help.\\n\\n- Refer to a global variable name, typically with two or more characters, that is not likely to exist outside of the function or program.\\n- Include `DelVar` within the function or program to delete the global variable, if it exists, before referring to it. (`DelVar` does not delete locked or archived variables.)\\nA string is a sequence of characters enclosed in \\\"quotes\\\". In programming, strings allow the program to display information or prompt the user to perform some action. For example:\\n\\n```\\nDisp \\\"The result is\\\",answer\\nor\\nInput \\\"Enter the angle in degrees\\\",angl\\nor\\n\\\"Enter the angle in degrees\\\"\\u2192str1\\nInput str1,angl\\n```\\n\\nSome input commands (such as `inputStr`) automatically store user input as a string and do not require the user to enter quotation marks.\\n\\nA string cannot be evaluated mathematically, even if it appears to be a numeric expression. For example, the string \\\"61\\\" represents the characters \\\"6\\\" and \\\"1\\\", not the number 61.\\n\\nAlthough you cannot use a string such as \\\"61\\\" or \\\"2x+4\\\" in a calculation, you can convert a string into a numeric expression by using the `expr` command.\\n| Command | Description |\\n|---------|-------------|\\n| #       | Converts a string into a variable name. This is called indirection. |\\n| &       | Appends (concatenates) two strings into one string. |\\n| char    | Returns the character that corresponds to a specified character code. This is the opposite of the ord command. |\\n| dim     | Returns the number of characters in a string. |\\n| expr    | Converts a string into an expression and executes that expression. This is the opposite of the string command. **Important:** Some user input commands store the entered value as a string. Before you can perform a mathematical operation on that value, you must convert it to a numeric expression. |\\n| format  | Returns an expression as a character string based on the format template (fixed, scientific, engineering, etc.). |\\n| inString| Searches a string to see if it contains a specified substring. If so, inString returns the character position where the first occurrence of the substring begins. |\\n| left    | Returns a specified number of characters from the left side (beginning) of a string. |\\n| mid     | Returns a specified number of characters from any position within a string. |\\n| ord     | Returns the character code of the first character within a string. This is the opposite of the char command. |\\n| right   | Returns a specified number of characters from the right side (end) of a string. |\\n| rotate  | Rotates the characters in a string. The default is -1 (rotate right one character). |\\n| shift   | Shifts the characters in a string and replaces them with spaces. The default is -1 (shift right one character and replace with one space). Examples: shift(\\\"abcde\\\",2)=\\\"cde * and shift(\\\"abcde\\\")=\\\" abcd\\\" |\\n| string  | Converts a numeric expression into a string. This is the opposite of the expr command. |\\n\\nNote: See Appendix A for syntax for all TI-89 / TI-92 Plus commands and functions.\\nConditional Tests\\n\\nConditional tests let programs make decisions. For example, depending on whether a test is true or false, a program can decide which of two actions to perform. Conditional tests are used with control structures such as `If...EndIf` and loops such as `While...EndWhile` (described later in this chapter).\\n\\nEntering a Test Operator\\n\\n- Type the operator directly from the keyboard.\\n  \\u2014 or \\u2014\\n  - Press `2nd [MATH]` and select `8:Test`. Then select the operator from the menu.\\n  \\u2014 or \\u2014\\n  - Display the built-in functions.\\n  Press:\\n\\n  **TI-89: CATALOG**\\n  **TI-92 Plus: 2nd [CATALOG]**\\n\\n  The test operators are listed near the bottom of the `F3` Built-in menu.\\n\\nRelational Tests\\n\\nRelational operators let you define a conditional test that compares two values. The values can be numbers, expressions, lists, or matrices (but they must match in type and dimension).\\n\\n| Operator | True if: | Example |\\n|----------|----------|---------|\\n| `>`      | Greater than | `a>8` |\\n| `<`      | Less than | `a<0` |\\n| `>=` or `>` | Greater than or equal to | `a+b>100` |\\n| `<=` or `<` | Less than or equal to | `a+6<=b+1` |\\n| `=`      | Equal | `list1=list2` |\\n| `!=` or `/=` | Not equal to | `mat1!=mat2` |\\n\\nBoolean Tests\\n\\nBoolean operators let you combine the results of two separate tests.\\n\\n| Operator | True if: | Example |\\n|----------|----------|---------|\\n| `and`    | Both tests are true | `a>0 and a<10` |\\n| `or`     | At least one test is true | `a<0 or b>c>10` |\\n| `xor`    | One test is true and the other is false | `a+6<b+1 xor c<d` |\\n\\nThe Not Function\\n\\nThe `not` function changes the result of a test from true to false and vice versa. For example:\\n\\n- `not x>2` is true if `x<2`\\n- `not x>2` is false if `x>2`\\n\\n**Note:** If you use `not` from the Home screen, it is shown as `-` in the history area. For example, `not x>2` is shown as `-x>2`.\\nUsing If, Lbl, and Goto to Control Program Flow\\n\\nAn If...EndIf structure uses a conditional test to decide whether or not to execute one or more commands. Lbl (label) and Goto commands can also be used to branch (or jump) from one place to another in a program.\\n\\nControl Toolbar Menu\\nTo enter If...EndIf structures, use the Program Editor's [ ] Control toolbar menu.\\n\\nThe If command is available directly from the [ ] menu.\\nTo see a submenu that lists other If structures, select 2:If...Then.\\nWhen you select a structure such as If...Then...EndIf, a template is inserted at the cursor location.\\n\\nIf Command\\nTo execute only one command if a conditional test is true, use the general form:\\n\\n```\\n:If x>5\\n  Disp \\\"x is greater than 5\\\"\\n:Disp x\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, you must store a value to x before executing the If command.\\n\\nIf...Then...EndIf Structures\\nTo execute multiple commands if a conditional test is true, use the structure:\\n\\n```\\n:If x>5 Then\\n  Disp \\\"x is greater than 5\\\"\\n  2x\\n  x\\n:EndIf\\n:Disp x\\n```\\n\\nTip: Use indentation to make your programs easier to read and understand.\\n\\nNote: EndIf marks the end of the Then block that is executed if the condition is true.\\n\\nExecuted only if x>5; otherwise, skipped.\\nAlways displays the value of x.\\nExecuted only if x>5.\\nDisplays value of:\\n  \\u2022 2x if x>5.\\n  \\u2022 x if x<5.\\n### If...Then...Else...EndIf Structures\\n\\nTo execute one group of commands if a conditional test is true and a different group if the condition is false, use this structure:\\n\\n| Condition          | Command                           |\\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\\n| x > 5              | :Disp \\\"x is greater than 5\\\"       |\\n|                    | :2\\u00d7x\\u2192x                             |\\n| Else               |                                    |\\n| x \\u2264 5              | :Disp \\\"x is less than or equal to 5\\\" |\\n|                    | :5\\u00d7x\\u2192x                             |\\n| EndIf              |                                    |\\n\\nDisplays value of:\\n- 2x if x > 5.\\n- 5x if x \\u2264 5.\\n\\n### If...Then...ElseIf...EndIf Structures\\n\\nA more complex form of the `If` command lets you test a series of conditions. Suppose your program prompts the user for a number that corresponds to one of four options. To test for each option (If Choice = 1, If Choice = 2, etc.), use the `If...Then...ElseIf...EndIf` structure.\\n\\nRefer to Appendix A for more information and an example.\\n\\n### Lbl and Goto Commands\\n\\nYou can also control the flow of your program by using `Lbl` (label) and `Goto` commands.\\n\\nUse the `Lbl` command to label (assign a name to) a particular location in the program.\\n\\n```\\nLbl  labelName  \\n```\\n\\nname to assign to this location (use the same naming convention as a variable name)\\n\\nYou can then use the `Goto` command at any point in the program to branch to the location that corresponds to the specified label.\\n\\n```\\nGoto  labelName  \\n```\\nspecifies which `Lbl` command to branch to\\n\\nBecause a `Goto` command is unconditional (it always branches to the specified label), it is often used with an `If` command so that you can specify a conditional test. For example:\\n\\n```\\n:If x>5\\n  Goto GT5\\n  :Disp x\\n:-------------------\\n  Lbl GT5\\n  :Disp \\\"The number was > 5\\\"\\n```\\n\\nIf x > 5, branches directly to label GT5.\\n\\nFor this example, the program must include commands (such as `Stop`) that prevent Lbl GT5 from being executed if x \\u2264 5.\\nUsing Loops to Repeat a Group of Commands\\n\\nTo enter most of the loop-related commands, use the Program Editor's [F2] Control toolbar menu. When you select a loop, the loop command and its corresponding End command are inserted at the cursor location.\\n\\nYou can then begin entering the commands that will be executed in the loop.\\n\\nFor...EndFor Loops\\n\\nA For...EndFor loop uses a counter to control the number of times the loop is repeated. The syntax of the For command is:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{For}(\\\\text{variable}, \\\\text{begin}, \\\\text{end} [, \\\\text{increment}]) \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{added to the counter each subsequent time For is executed (if this optional value is omitted, the increment is 1.)} \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{exits the loop when } \\\\text{variable} \\\\text{ exceeds this value} \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{counter value used the first time For is executed} \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{variable used as a counter} \\\\]\\n\\nWhen For is executed, the variable value is compared to the end value. If variable does not exceed end, the loop is executed; otherwise, program control jumps to the command following EndFor.\\n\\n\\\\[ i \\\\geq 5 \\\\quad i \\\\leq 5 \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ :\\\\text{for } 1,0,5,1 \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ : \\\\quad \\\\ldots \\\\quad \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ :\\\\text{EndFor} \\\\quad : \\\\quad \\\\]\\n\\nAt the end of the loop (EndFor), program control jumps back to the For command, where variable is incremented and compared to end.\\nFor example:\\n\\n```\\n:For i,0,5,1\\n  Disp i\\n:EndFor\\nDisp i\\n```\\n\\nA **While...EndWhile** loop repeats a block of commands as long as a specified condition is true. The syntax of the **While** command is:\\n\\n**While condition**\\n\\nWhen **While** is executed, the condition is evaluated. If **condition** is true, the loop is executed; otherwise, program control jumps to the command following **EndWhile**.\\n\\nAt the end of the loop (**EndWhile**), program control jumps back to the **While** command, where **condition** is re-evaluated.\\n\\nTo execute the loop the first time, the **condition** must initially be true.\\n\\n- Any variables referenced in the **condition** must be set before the **While** command. (You can build the values into the program or prompt the user to enter the values.)\\n- The loop must contain commands that change the values in the **condition**, eventually causing it to be false. Otherwise, the **condition** is always true and the program cannot exit the loop (called an infinite loop).\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```\\n:0\\\\(x\\\\)\\n:While \\\\(x<5\\\\)\\n  Disp \\\\(x\\\\)\\n  \\\\(x\\\\)+1\\\\(x\\\\)\\n:EndWhile\\nDisp \\\\(x\\\\)\\n```\\n\\nDisplays 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\\n\\nIncrements \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\nDisplays 5. When \\\\(x\\\\) increments to 5, the loop is not executed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Tip:** You can declare the counter variable as local (pages 288 and 290) if it does not need to be saved after the program stops.\\nLoop...EndLoop\\n\\nLoops\\n\\nA `Loop...EndLoop` creates an infinite loop, which is repeated endlessly. The `Loop` command does not have any arguments.\\n\\n```\\n:Loop\\n  ;-------\\n  ;-------\\n  :EndLoop\\n  ;-------\\n```\\n\\nTypically, the loop contains commands that let the program exit from the loop. Commonly used commands are: `If`, `Exit`, `Goto`, and `Lbl` (label). For example:\\n\\n```\\n0\\u2192x\\n:Loop\\n  :Disp x\\n  :x+1\\u2192x\\n  :If x>5\\n  :  Exit\\n  :EndLoop\\n  :Disp x\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `If` command can be anywhere in the loop.\\n\\nWhen the `If` command is:  |  The loop is:\\nAt the beginning of the loop |  Executed only if the condition is true.\\nAt the end of the loop     |  Executed at least once and repeated only if the condition is true.\\n\\nThe `If` command could also use a `Goto` command to transfer program control to a specified `Lbl` (label) command.\\n\\nRepeating a Loop Immediately\\n\\nThe `Cycle` command immediately transfers program control to the next iteration of a loop (before the current iteration is complete). This command works with `For...EndFor`, `While...EndWhile`, and `Loop...EndLoop`.\\n\\nLbl and Goto Loops\\n\\nAlthough the `Lbl` (label) and `Goto` commands are not strictly loop commands, they can be used to create an infinite loop. For example:\\n\\n```\\n:Lbl START\\n  ;-------\\n  ;-------\\n  :Goto START\\n  ;-------\\n```\\n\\nAs with `Loop...EndLoop`, the loop should contain commands that let the program exit from the loop.\\n## Configuring the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus\\n\\nPrograms can contain commands that change the configuration of the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus. Because mode changes are particularly useful, the Program Editor's **Mode** toolbar menu makes it easy to enter the correct syntax for the **setMode** command.\\n\\n### Configuration Commands\\n\\n| Command   | Description                                      |\\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|\\n| getConfg  | Returns a list of calculator characteristics.    |\\n| getFold   | Returns the name of the current folder.          |\\n| getMode   | Returns the current setting for a specified mode.|\\n| getUnits  | Returns a list of default units.                 |\\n| setFold   | Sets the current folder.                         |\\n| setGraph  | Sets a specified graph format (Coordinates, Graph Order, etc.). |\\n| setMode   | Sets any mode except Current Folder.             |\\n| setTable  | Sets a specified table setup parameter (tblStart, tbl, etc.) |\\n| setUnits  | Sets default units for displayed results.        |\\n| switch    | Sets the active window in a split screen, or returns the number of the active window. |\\n\\n**Note:** The parameter/mode strings used in the **setMode( )**, **getMode( )**, **setGraph( )**, and **setTable( )** functions do not translate into other languages when used in a program. See Appendix D.\\n\\n### Entering the SetMode Command\\n\\nIn the Program Editor:\\n\\n1. Position the cursor where you want to insert the **setMode** command.\\n\\n2. Press:\\n\\n   - **TI-89:**  \\n   - **TI-92 Plus:**\\n\\n   to display a list of modes.\\n\\n3. Select a mode to display a menu of its valid settings.\\n4. Select a setting.\\n\\n   The correct syntax is inserted into your program.\\n\\n   ```\\n   :setMode(\\\"Graph\\\",\\\"FUNCTION\\\")\\n   ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n300  Chapter 17: Programming\\nTo enter most of the commonly used input/output commands, use the Program Editor's I/O toolbar menu.\\n\\nTo see a submenu that lists additional commands, select 1:Dialog.\\n\\n### Input Commands\\n\\n| Command   | Description |\\n|-----------|-------------|\\n| getKey    | Returns the key code of the next key pressed. See Appendix B for a listing of key codes. |\\n| Input     | Prompts the user to enter an expression. The expression is treated according to how it is entered. For example:  \\n- A numeric expression is treated as an expression.  \\n- An expression enclosed in \\\"quotes\\\" is treated as a string. Input can also display the Graph screen and let the user update the variables xc and yc (rc and qc in polar mode) by positioning the graph cursor. |\\n| InputStr   | Prompts the user to enter an expression. The expression is always treated as a string; the user does not need to enclose the expression in \\\"quotes\\\". |\\n| PopUp      | Displays a pop-up menu box and lets the user select an item. |\\n| Prompt     | Prompts the user to enter a series of expressions. As with input, each expression is treated according to how it is entered. |\\n| Request    | Displays a dialog box that prompts the user to enter an expression. Request always treats the entered expression as a string. |\\n\\n**Tip:** String input cannot be used in a calculation. To convert a string to a numeric expression, use the expr command.\\nOutput Commands\\n\\n| Command | Description |\\n|---------|-------------|\\n| ClrIO   | Clears the Program I/O screen. |\\n| Disp    | Displays an expression or string on the Program I/O screen. *Disp* can also display the current contents of the Program I/O screen without displaying additional information. |\\n| DispG   | Displays the current contents of the Graph screen. |\\n| DispHome| Displays the current contents of the Home screen. |\\n| DispTbl | Displays the current contents of the Table screen. |\\n| Output  | Displays an expression or string starting at specified coordinates on the Program I/O screen. |\\n| Format  | Formats the way in which numeric information is displayed. |\\n\\n**Tip:** After *Disp* and *Output*, the program immediately continues. You may want to add a *Pause* command.\\n\\nNote: In a program, simply performing a calculation does not display the result. You must use an output command.\\n\\nGraphical User Interface Commands\\n\\n| Command | Description |\\n|---------|-------------|\\n| Dialog... | Defines a program block (consisting of *Title*, *Request*, etc., commands) that displays a dialog box. |\\n| EndDlog | |\\n| Toolbar... | Defines a program block (consisting of *Title*, *Item*, etc., commands) that replaces the toolbar menus. The redefined toolbar is in effect only while the program is running and only until the user selects an item. Then the original toolbar is redisplayed. |\\n| EndTbar | |\\n| CustmOn... | Activates or removes a custom toolbar. |\\n| CustmOff | |\\n| Custom... | Defines a program block that displays a custom toolbar when the user presses `[2nd] [CUSTOM]`. That toolbar remains in effect until the user presses `[2nd] [CUSTOM]` again or changes applications. |\\n| EndCustm | |\\n|DropDown | Displays a drop-down menu within a dialog box. |\\n| Item    | Displays a menu item for a redefined toolbar. |\\n| Request | Creates an input box within a dialog box. |\\n| Text    | Displays a character string within a dialog box. |\\n| Title   | Displays the title of a dialog box or a menu title within a toolbar. |\\n\\n**Tip:** When you run a program that sets up a custom toolbar, that toolbar is still available even after the program has stopped.\\n\\nNote: *Request* and *Text* are stand-alone commands that can also be used outside of a dialog box or toolbar program block.\\nCreating a Custom Menu\\n\\nThe TI-89 / TI-92 Plus custom menu feature lets you create your own toolbar menu. A custom menu can contain any available function, instruction, or set of characters. The TI-89 / TI-92 Plus has a default custom menu that you can modify or redefine.\\n\\nTurning the Custom Menu On and Off\\n\\nWhen you create a custom menu, you can let the user turn it on and off manually, or you can let a program turn it on and off automatically.\\n\\n| To:       | Do this:                                                                 |\\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Turn on the custom menu | From the Home screen or any other application:                           |\\n|           | \\u2022 Press [2][CUSTOM].                                                      |\\n|           | From the Home screen or a program:                                       |\\n|           | \\u2022 Execute the CustmOn command.                                           |\\n| Turn off the custom menu | From any application:                                                    |\\n|           | \\u2022 Press [2][CUSTOM] again.                                               |\\n|           | \\u2014 or \\u2014                                                                  |\\n|           | \\u2022 Go to a different application.                                         |\\n|           | Using the default custom menu on the Home screen:                       |\\n|           | 1.

Copy those commands, use the Program Editor to create a new program, and paste them into the blank program. Then modify the commands as necessary.\\n\\nYou can create and use only one custom menu at a time. If you need more, write a separate program for each custom menu. Then run the program for the menu you need.\\n\\nTo restore the default:\\n\\n1. From the Home screen's normal menu (not the custom menu), select Clean Up:\\n   - **TI-89:** `fn` `f5`\\n   - **TI-92 Plus:** `f6`\\n\\n2. Select 3:Restore custom default.\\n   This pastes the commands used to create the default menu into the entry line.\\n\\n3. Press `ENTER` to execute the commands and restore the default.\\n   When you restore the default, any previous custom menu is erased. If the previous menu was created with a program, you can run the program again if you want to reuse the menu later.\\n\\n**Note:** The following may be slightly different than the default custom menu on your calculator.\\n\\n**Note:** See how \\\"_o\\\\C\\\" and \\\"_o\\\\F\\\" display as \\\"C\\\" and \\\"F\\\" in the menu. Similarly, see the international accented characters.\\n\\n**Note:** This inserts all the commands on a single line. You do not need to split them into separate lines.\\n\\n**Restoring the Default Custom Menu**\\n\\n304 Chapter 17: Programming\\n## Creating a Table or Graph\\n\\nTo create a table or a graph based on one or more functions or equations, use the commands listed in this section.\\n\\n### Table Commands\\n\\n| Command | Description |\\n|---------|-------------|\\n| DispTbl | Displays the current contents of the Table screen. |\\n| setTable | Sets the Graph <-> Table or Independent table parameters.

Press (F3) and select 8:Link.\\n2. Select a command.\\n\\n**Accessing Another TI-89 / TI-92 Plus**\\n\\nWhen two TI-89 / TI-92 Plus calculators are linked, one acts as a receiving unit and the other as a sending unit.\\n\\n| Command  | Description                                                                 |\\n|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| GetCalc  | Executed on the receiving unit. Sets up the unit to receive a variable via the I/O port. |\\n|          | \\u2022 After the receiving unit executes GetCalc, the sending unit must execute SendCalc. |\\n|          | \\u2022 After the sending unit executes SendCalc, the sent variable is stored on the receiving unit (in the variable name specified by GetCalc). |\\n| SendCalc | Executed on the sending unit. Sends a variable to the receiving unit via the I/O port. |\\n|          | \\u2022 Before the sending unit executes SendCalc, the receiving unit must execute GetCalc. |\\n| SendChat | Executed on the sending unit as a general alternative to SendCalc. Useful if the receiving unit is a TI-92 (or for a generic 'chat' program that allows either a TI-92 or TI-92 Plus to be used). |\\n\\n**Accessing a CBL 2/CBL or CBR**\\n\\nFor additional information, refer to the manual that comes with the CBL 2/CBL or CBR unit.\\n\\n| Command | Description                                                                 |\\n|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Get     | Gets a variable from an attached CBL 2/CBL or CBR and stores it in the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus. |\\n| Send    | Sends a list variable from the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus to the CBL 2/CBL or CBR. |\\nDebugging Programs and Handling Errors\\n\\nRun-Time Errors\\n\\nThe first step in debugging your program is to run it. The TI-89/TI-92 Plus automatically checks each executed command for syntax errors. If there is an error, a message indicates the nature of the error.\\n\\n- To display the program in the Program Editor, press [ENTER]. The cursor appears in the approximate area of the error.\\n- To cancel program execution and return to the Home screen, press [ESC].\\n\\nIf your program allows the user to select from several options, be sure to run the program and test each option.\\n\\nDebugging Techniques\\n\\nRun-time error messages can locate syntax errors but not errors in program logic. The following techniques may be useful.\\n\\n- During testing, do not use local variables so that you can check the variable values after the program stops. When the program is debugged, declare the applicable variables as local.\\n- Within a program, temporarily insert `Disp` and `Pause` commands to display the values of critical variables.\\n  - `Disp` and `Pause` cannot be used in a user-defined function. To temporarily change the function into a program, change `Func` and `EndFunc` to `Prgm` and `EndPrgm`. Use `Disp` and `Pause` to debug the program. Then remove `Disp` and `Pause` and change the program back into a function.\\n- To confirm that a loop is executed the correct number of times, display the counter variable or the values in the conditional test.\\n- To confirm that a subroutine is executed, display messages such as \\\"Entering subroutine\\\" and \\\"Exiting subroutine\\\" at the beginning and end of the subroutine.\\n\\nError-Handling Commands\\n\\n| Command       | Description                                                                 |\\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Try...EndTry  | Defines a program block that lets the program execute a command and, if necessary, recover from an error generated by that command. |\\n| ClErr         | Clears the error status and sets the error number in system variable ErrorNum to zero. |\\n| PassErr       | Passes an error to the next level of the Try...EndTry block.                |\\n\\nAfter you write a program, you can use several techniques to find and correct errors. You can also build an error-handling command into the program itself.\\nExample: Using Alternative Approaches\\n\\nThe preview at the beginning of this chapter shows a program that prompts the user to enter an integer, sums all integers from 1 to the entered integer, and displays the result. This section gives several approaches that you can use to achieve the same goal.\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\nThis example is the program given in the preview at the beginning of the chapter. Refer to the preview for detailed information.\\n\\n```\\n:prog1()\\n:Prgm\\n:Request \\\"Enter an integer\\\", n\\n:expr(n)\\n! n\\n:0\\n! temp\\n:For i, 1, n, 1\\n  temp + i\\n  ! temp\\n:EndFor\\n:Disp temp\\n:EndPrgm\\n```\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\nThis example uses `InputStr` for input, a `While...EndWhile` loop to calculate the result, and `Text` to display the result.\\n\\n```\\n:prog2()\\n:Prgm\\n:InputStr \\\"Enter an integer\\\", n\\n:expr(n) > i\\n:0 > temp\\n:i + 1 > i\\n:While i < n\\n  temp + i\\n  ! temp\\n:EndWhile\\n:Text \\\"The answer is \\\" & string(temp)\\n:EndPrgm\\n```\\n\\nExample 3\\n\\nThis example uses `Prompt` for input, `Lbl` and `Goto` to create a loop, and `Disp` to display the result.\\n\\n```\\n:prog3()\\n:Prgm\\n:Prompt n\\n:0 > temp\\n:i + 1 > i\\n:Lbl top\\n  temp + i\\n  ! temp\\n:If i = n\\n  :Goto top\\n:Disp temp\\n:EndPrgm\\n```\\n\\nTip: For \\u00ab, type \\u00e5 (zero).\\nFor &, press:\\nTI-89: \\u00e4 (times)\\nTI-92 Plus: \\u00a9 H\\n\\nNote: Because `Prompt` returns n as a number, you do not need to use `expr` to convert n.\\n**Example 4**\\n\\nThis example uses `Dialog...EndDlog` to create dialog boxes for input and output. It uses `Loop...EndLoop` to calculate the result.\\n\\n```\\n:prog4()\\nPrgm\\n  Dialog\\n    : Title \\\"Enter an integer\\\"\\n    : Request \\\"Integer\\\", n\\n  :EndDlog\\n  :expr(n)>n\\n  :0>temp:0>i\\n  :Loop\\n    : temp+i>temp\\n    : i+i>i\\n    : If i>n\\n    : Exit\\n  :EndLoop\\n  :Dialog\\n    : Title \\\"The answer is\\\"\\n    : Text string(temp)\\n  :EndDlog\\n:EndPrgm\\n```\\n\\n**Example 5**\\n\\nThis example uses the TI-89/TI-92 Plus built-in functions to calculate the result without using a loop.\\n\\n```\\n:prog5()\\nPrgm\\n  :Input \\\"Enter an integer\\\", n\\n  :sum(seq(i,i,1,n))>temp\\n  :Disp temp\\n  :EndPrgm\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** Because `Input` returns `n` as a number, you do not need to use `expr` to convert `n`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Function Used in this example to:**\\n\\n- `seq` Generate the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.\\n\\n  `seq(expression, var, low, high [,step])`\\n\\n  - Expression used to generate the sequence\\n  - Variable that will be incremented\\n  - Initial and final values of `var`\\n  - Increment for `var`; if omitted, uses 1.\\n\\n- `sum` Sum the integers in the list generated by `seq`.\\nAssembly-Language Programs\\n\\nYou can run programs written for the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus in assembly language. Typically, assembly-language programs run much faster and provide greater control than the keystroke programs that you write with the built-in Program Editor.\\n\\nWhere to Get Assembly-Language Programs\\n\\nAssembly-language programs, as well as keystroke programs, are available on the Texas Instruments web site at:\\n\\neducation.ti.com\\n\\nThe programs available from this site provide additional functions or features that are not built into the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus. Check the Texas Instruments web site for up-to-date information.\\n\\nAfter downloading a program from the web to your computer, use a TI-GRAPH LINK\\u2122 computer-to-calculator cable to send the program to your TI-89 / TI-92 Plus. Refer to the manual that comes with the TI-GRAPH LINK cable.\\n\\nNote about TI-GRAPH LINK\\n\\nIf you have a TI-GRAPH LINK computer-to-calculator cable and software for the TI-92, be aware that the TI-92 TI-GRAPH LINK software is not compatible with the TI-89 / TI-92 Plus. The cable, however, works with both units. For information about obtaining TI\\u2122 Connect or TI-GRAPH LINK software or a TI-GRAPH LINK cable, check the Texas Instruments web site at education.ti.com or contact Texas Instruments as described in Appendix C of this guidebook.\\n\\nRunning an Assembly-Language Program\\n\\nAfter a TI-89 / TI-92 Plus assembly-language program is stored on your unit, you can run the program from the Home screen just as you would any other program.\\n\\nTip: If the program is not in the current folder, be sure to specify the pathname.\\n\\nYou can call an assembly-language program from another program as a subroutine, delete it, or use it the same as any other program.\\nOn the Home screen, you can use keyboard shortcuts to run up to nine user-defined or assembly-language programs. However, the programs must have the following names.\\n\\n| On Home screen, press: | To run a program, if any, named: |\\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------|\\n| [1]                   | kbdprgm1()                       |\\n| ...                   | ...                             |\\n| [9]                   | kbdprgm9()                       |\\n\\nIf you have a program with a different name and you would like to run it with a keyboard shortcut, copy or rename the existing program to kbdprgm1(), etc.\\n\\nYou cannot use your TI-89 / TI-92 Plus to edit an assembly-language program. The built-in Program Editor will not open assembly-language programs.\\n\\nTo list the assembly-language programs stored in memory:\\n1. Display the VAR-LINK screen (VAR-LINK).\\n2. Press [View].\\n3. Select the applicable folder (or All folders) and set Var Type = Assembly.\\n4. Press [ENTER] to display the list of assembly-language programs.\\n\\nThe information required to teach a novice programmer how to write an assembly-language program is beyond the scope of this book. However, if you have a working knowledge of assembly language, please check the Texas Instruments web site (education.ti.com) for specific information about how to access TI-89 / TI-92 Plus features.\\n\\nThe TI-89 / TI-92 Plus also includes an Exec command that executes a string consisting of a series of Motorola 68000 op-codes. These codes act as another form of an assembly-language program.

As the Minnesota judgment threatened to domino through different US state copycat trials, the tobacco industry struck the historic Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with the US state attorneys general in November 1998. The MSA provided for $206 billion to be paid by the companies to the states, and significantly, that all documents \\u201cdiscovered\\u201d in any trial up until 2010 be placed on the world wide web. Today, some 40 million pages of previously private memos, faxes, reports, and letters are available to anyone with a computer (see http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/).\\n\\nFaced with this Niagara of embarrassing revelations, including thousands from its highest officials, the international industry changed strategy. It embarked on the world\\u2019s most public rebirthing exercise, asking to henceforth be appreciated as an ethical industry devoted to providing tobacco products to sentient adults, all supposedly fully informed of the risks they took. No longer was the relation between smoking and illness merely a dubious \\u201cstatistical association\\u201d, the new tobacco industry now admits in carefully weasel worded statements that tobacco use is a highly risky practice. As British American Tobacco (BAT) carefully put it this year in its 2003/4 Social Report: \\u201cOur main role is to recognise the relevant health authorities as the prime public voice on the health risks of tobacco consumption, while at the same time making our views clear.\\u201d Translated, this might mean: \\u201cLike everyone else, we can see it is a fact that health authorities are the main voice on smoking and health. We \\u2018recognise\\u2019 this, but we also have \\u2018our views\\u2019 on smoking and health and we\\u2019ll take every opportunity to make them clear to governments trying to do heinous things like place graphic photos of tobacco diseases on packs.\\u201d In 2004, BAT Australia, for example, fresh from gushing about its dedication to informing smokers about risk, lobbied hard to dissuade governments to shelve plans for these warnings, including funding of retail petitions where its role was not acknowledged.2\\n\\nFor the reborn industry, no longer was nicotine a simple \\u201chabit\\u201d akin to liking chewing gum, chocolate, or television viewing. BAT now concedes \\u201cThe common understanding is that nicotine is addictive\\u201d.1 Translated, this means: \\u201cWe concede that everyone says nicotine is addictive, but we don\\u2019t necessarily agree. And if someone claims in court they were addicted to our products, we\\u2019ll probably keep on doing what we have been doing for years and challenge that, pointing to all the ex-smokers in the community.\\u201d\\n\\nThere is wholesale cynicism and disgust in health and medical circles about this exercise. Critics point out that contrary to the most elementary procedures for wrongfuldoers seeking public contrition, the industry has made no public apology about its years of misleading conduct to accompany its volte face. Doubtless mindful of the legal ramifications of doing so, it has made no admissions that it lied to smokers in the past, and that for decades it engaged in a globally orchestrated campaign to falsely reassure smokers. It has made no gestures to compensate those it has harmed. It remains implacable in its refusal to acknowledge that intriguing children about smoking is intrinsic to its continuing future economic welfare. Indeed it is so sincere in not wanting children to smoke, that it refuses to hand back its annual massive earnings from underage smokers, whom it says ad nauseam it doesn\\u2019t want to smoke.\\n\\nDENORMALISATION IN ACTION\\n\\nEmboldened in their fetching new sheepskins, and refreshed from sipping homeopathic strength truth serum, tobacco industry wolves are doing the rounds of the world\\u2019s corporate responsibility conferences. On 26 May 2004, corporate responsibility watcher Bert Hirschhorn noticed that BAT and Philip Morris were getting home page billing as speakers and gold sponsors (fig 1) at a conference to be held in Hong Kong in October 2004 run by Ethical Corporation magazine. Email alerts saw tobacco control activists Mary Assunta from Malaysia and Professor Tony Hedley from Hong Kong contact Asian delegates listed as speaking at the conference. Hedley also protested to his university chancellor over the involvement of his university\\u2019s business school in the event. Stan Shatenstein and I set up an online petition on Globalink for professional ethicists.\\nto condemn the tobacco industry\\u2019s involvement. I emailed the link to colleagues in my own university\\u2019s Department of Philosophy inviting them to sign and to then forward the link to the petition to their international colleagues in ethics. Within days, some 86 ethicists had signed, including bioethics heavyweights Peter Singer from Princeton University and Arthur Kaplan from the University of Pennsylvania.\\n\\nThe two tobacco companies disappeared from the conference website within a week of the campaign commencing. Staff at Ethical Corporation advised us that they had received heated complaints about tobacco industry involvement and that they had advised Philip Morris that their sponsorship was cancelled and were considering whether to cancel BAT\\u2019s speaking role: \\u201cThis furore made us realise that there are some companies who we cannot take sponsorship money from, this list of industry sectors, along with tobacco, includes defence, nuclear and biotechnology.\\u201d Two speakers withdrew from the conference in protest and the conference went ahead without tobacco involvement.\\n\\nA second opportunity arose to test this strategy in July in Sydney when a website advertising the \\u201cAustralian Public Relations and Corporate Communications Summit 2004\\u201d showed a Philip Morris representative on the programme. All speakers were emailed a letter signed by myself and the head of the Cancer Council New South Wales, Dr Andrew Penman. We wrote, in part:\\n\\n\\u201cThis conference is giving a stage to a company to gloat about its \\u201cstrategies\\u201d and to portray itself in a good light. Philip Morris has been engaging in a global program of spending vast sums of money to publicise its support for programs like domestic violence awareness, carefully selected to ensure that it is largely immune from criticism. In Australia it has even funded an Aboriginal health promotion campaign, knowing well that our indigenous populations have among the highest smoking rates in the country.\\n\\n\\u201cIt funds highly-publicised youth smoking prevention programs, yet is content to keep the large amounts of revenue it derives from under-age smokers each year.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are writing to all keynote speakers to urge you to put pressure on the organizers of this conference to have Philip Morris removed from the program. If the organizers do not agree to this, we would urge you to withdraw your own participation. We will be seeking to bring maximum publicity to our efforts to urge all other speakers to withdraw and hope that we will be able to highlight your responsible action in this matter.\\n\\n\\u201cIn considering your participation, you may wish to consider whether you and your organization would be prepared to speak at a conference that had also invited an arms dealer to speak. Or a mercenary recruitment agency. Or the public relations division of a despotic nation. Or the gun lobby. Or a racist political party. Each of these organizations are, like tobacco companies, also \\u201clegal\\u201d.\\n\\nAt least two prominent business speakers contacted the organisers, threatening to withdraw should Philip Morris remain on the programme. The organisers promptly \\u201cde-invited\\u201d Philip Morris from the programme.\\n\\nWHY SO EASY?\\nThe speed by which the organisers of both conferences showed their already invited tobacco industry sponsors and speakers the back door was remarkable. Despite Philip Morris being a \\u201cgold sponsor\\u201d, a simple show of protest consisting of a few emails and phone calls was sufficient to abort their involvement in both conferences.\\n\\nThe tobacco industry has had many doors closed in its face over the years. The BAT Social Report shows that no UK public health or tobacco control groups chose to participate in its consultations (reference 1, page 16). Similar refusal to buy into the industry\\u2019s oleaginous talk about dialogue with...\\nstakeholders has occurred in other nations, with groups and individuals refusing to risk being appropriated into the industry\\u2019s public relations ambitions. It now looks like that with vigilance, tobacco control advocates can easily foment similar distaste in many areas of the business community. Our actions sought to denormalise the tobacco industry by disrupting its efforts to take its place alongside other industries\\u2014often with considerable social credit\\u2014in the hope that it might gain by association.\\n\\nTobacco industry posturing about its corporate responsibility can never hide the ugly consequences of its ongoing efforts to \\u201cwork with all relevant stakeholders for the preservation of opportunities for informed adults to consume tobacco products\\u201d (translation: \\u201cwe will build alliances with others who want to profit from tobacco use, to do all we can to counteract effective tobacco control\\u201d). BAT has 15.4% and Philip Morris 16.4% of the global cigarette market. With 4.9 million smokers currently dying from tobacco use each year, and the industry unblinkingly concurring that its products are addictive, this leaves BAT to argue why it should not be held to be largely accountable for the annual deaths of some 754,600 smokers, and Philip Morris some 803,600 smokers.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n1 British American Tobacco.

Geneva: World Health Organization, 2002.\\n\\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) emerged from a realisation among transnational corporations of the need to account for and redress their adverse impact on society: specifically, on human rights, labour practices, and the environment. Two transnational tobacco companies have recently adopted CSR: Philip Morris, and British American Tobacco. This report explains the origins and theory behind CSR; examines internal company documents from Philip Morris showing the company\\u2019s deliberations on the matter, and the company\\u2019s perspective on its own behaviour; and reflects on whether marketing tobacco is antithetical to social responsibility.\\n\\nO ver the past three decades increasing pressure from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), governments, and the United Nations, has required transnational corporations (TNCs) to examine and redress the adverse impact their businesses have on society and the environment. Many have responded by taking up what is known as \\u201ccorporate social responsibility\\u201d (CSR); only recently have two major cigarette companies followed suit: Philip Morris (PM) and British American Tobacco (BAT). This report first provides the context and development of CSR; then, from internal company documents, examines how PM came to its own version. This paper examines whether a tobacco company espousing CSR should be judged simply as a corporate entity along standards of business ethics, or as an irretrievably negative force in the realm of public health, thereby rendering CSR an oxymoron.\\n\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: THE CONTEXT\\nThe term \\u201ccorporate social responsibility\\u201d is in vogue at the moment but as a concept it is vague and means different things to different people. Some writers on CSR trace its American roots to the 19th century when large industries engaged in philanthropy and established great public institutions, a form of \\u201cnoblesse oblige\\u201d. But the notion that corporations should be required to return more to society because of their impact on society was driven by pressures from the civil rights, peace, and environmental movements of the last half century. The unprecedented expansion of power and influence of TNCs over the past three decades has accelerated global trade and development, but also environmental damage and abuses of\\n\\nAbbreviations: ASH, Action on Smoking and Health; BAT, British American Tobacco; CERES, Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies; CSR, corporate social responsibility; DJSI, Dow Jones Sustainability Index; GCAC, Global Corporate Affairs Council; GRI, Global Reporting Initiative; MSA, Master Settlement Agreement; NGOs, non-governmental organisations; PM, Philip Morris; TNCs, transnational corporations; UNEP, United Nations Environment Program\\n\\nwww.tobaccocontrol.com\\nhuman rights in factories and corporate agriculture. Union Carbide in Bhopal, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Royal Dutch/Shell Group behaviour in Nigeria, Nike sweatshops in Vietnam, Nestle marketing of powdered milk formula in developing countries, among others, energised the newly vibrant community of NGOs. These groups began to demand accountability from the TNCs beyond annual reports of profit and loss to include the economic, legal, environmental and social impacts of their businesses, backing up their demands with boycotts, publicity, and litigation. Some institutional and mutual fund purchasers of TNCs\\u2019 public stock began to screen which shares to buy under the rubric of \\u201csocially responsible investing\\u201d (SRI). In response some TNCs began to issue expanded public reports variously named \\u201csocial reporting\\u201d, \\u201ctriple bottom line\\u201d (economic, legal, social), \\u201ccorporate citizenship\\u201d, and \\u201ccorporate social responsibility\\u201d. Such accountability receives the imprimatur of the world community through the United Nations\\u2019 Global Compact, which brings together UN agencies, business, labour, and civil society organisations around nine principles modelling voluntary corporate social responsibility for human and labour rights and the environment. No tobacco company has signed on to the Global Compact.\\n\\nAttitudes toward CSR range widely. Milton Friedman, free-market guru and Nobel Prize winner in economics, dismissed the notion entirely some four decades ago: \\u201cFew trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundations of our free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social responsibility other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible.\\u201d More recently, free-market advocates like David Henderson deride CSR as \\u201cglobal salvationism\\u201d, leading to undesirable regulation of business, raising costs and diminishing both economic freedom and profits. Indeed, some theoreticians of CSR do argue that powerful corporations should act like citizens, with a moral conscience, being socially responsible because \\u201cit is the right thing to do,\\u201d even if it lowers profits (at least in the short term). A more middle ground has been taken up by leaders of TNCs belonging to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development; they promote CSR as both good for the world and for business. \\u201cCompanies do well, in fact, by doing good,\\u201d by creating \\u201cincredible goodwill and customer loyalty\\u201d. But TNC leaders insist that CSR be a voluntary gesture, not imposed by governments or international treaties. Thus as the European Commission\\u2019s \\u201cGreen Paper\\u201d acknowledges: \\u201cMost definitions of corporate social responsibility describe it as a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis.\\u201d\\n\\nNGOs are also divided; while many pressure corporations to take up CSR, others are dubious. Anti-globalisation NGOs see the corporate sign-on to the Global Compact, for example, as \\u201cbluewash\\u201d, simply hiding malfeasance behind the UN flag. Christian Aid wrote a scathing denunciation of CSR initiatives undertaken by Shell, Coca-Cola, and BAT: \\u201c...merely a branch of PR...consistently used CSR to block attempts to establish the mandatory regulation of the companies\\u2019 activities...saying that regulation is bad for their profits.\\u201d Christian Aid left no doubt that voluntary CSR \\u201cleft the worst corporate abusers unrestrained\\u201d and called for...international regulation, backed up by national legislation, to ensure the enforcement of real social responsibility on the corporate world. Introducing the threat of prosecution and legal action, with resulting detailed disclosure of company documents, would create a powerful incentive for companies to behave responsibly.\\n\\nHenderson agrees that many corporations have taken up CSR less out of conviction and more to deflect criticism from NGOs, the commitment being more apparent than real: \\u201c...a useful portmanteau description for a well-considered present-day business response to suspicion, pressures and attacks.\\u201d He believes, even so, that this is a naive view and will ultimately damage a free market economy.\\n\\nGiven the apparent enthusiasm for CSR, a whole new industry has grown up around it: academic journals, consultancies, research centres, financial advisors, business associations, NGOs, and international agencies. All seek to define and standardise CSR through codes and criteria for social reporting and corporate governance. The European Commission recently analysed a dozen such codes, all varying widely in scope, aspiration, content, and documentation and monitoring. Such diversity is a result of the voluntary nature of CSR over a broad range of industries.\\n\\nA leading CSR code is the AA1000S Assurance Standard developed by the Institute of Social and Ethical Accountability (a consulting firm deriving income from corporate, NGO, and individual \\u201cmemberships\\u201d and sale of services). Its set of criteria is based on \\u201cstakeholder engagement...[and] organisational responsiveness\\u201d to stakeholder concerns. Another leading code, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) originated with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the NGO Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES). GRI\\u2019s \\u201cSustainability Reporting Guidelines\\u201d is oriented to corporate behaviour in six categories: economic impacts, environment, labour practices, human rights, business ethics, and product responsibility. In the latter are included \\u201ccustomer health and safety\\u201d and advertising. BAT\\u2019s two annual social reports have selected elements of both the AA1000 and GRI standards.\\n\\nManagement theory on stakeholders proposes that large corporations have obligations beyond the traditional stockholder: \\u201csocial contracts\\u201d with customers, suppliers, employees, trade associations, political groups, NGOs, governments, communities, among others. A standard business school textbook provides numerous case studies to show that fiduciary responsibility accrues equally to stakeholders as to shareholders, and that an ethical responsibility to stakeholders requires corporations \\u201cnot to harm, coerce, lie, cheat, steal...\\u201d. Stakeholders are a principal focus of social responsibility declarations by both PM and BAT. Whether BAT even made a fair application of the stakeholder principle has been vigorously questioned by Action on Smoking and Health (ASH UK).\\n\\nOne economic incentive for voluntary CSR is several dozen \\u201csocial responsibility investment\\u201d stock portfolios that screen against certain corporations and industries, so-called \\u201csocial funds\\u201d. A typical example is the FTSE4Good index fund portfolio that does not hold stocks in the tobacco, weapons, nuclear power, and various mineral extracting and processing industries. The Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), however, while considered an SRI fund, invests in companies able to avoid environmental and social disasters, and so to keep a business robust. John A Prestbo, editor of Dow Jones Indexes, dismissed social responsibility as a \\u201cnegative perspective\\u201d. From an investor\\u2019s point-of-view, he avers, sustainability should focus primarily on increasing shareholder value. \\u201cAnother way of putting it would be that sustainability delivers fewer negative surprises.\\u201d\\n\\n*Including the International Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility at the University of Nottingham, UK, funded by British American Tobacco.\\nthe first, and so far only, tobacco company listed on the DJSL.\\n\\nThe 1990s were a decade full of \\u201cnegative surprises\\u201d for the tobacco industry: multiplying law suits, discovery and release of millions of pages of internal company documents, increasing restrictions on public smoking, legislative investigations, and growing political pressures to regulate the industry; all had dire implications for investor confidence and share price. The average citizen already had a low opinion of the industry, as illustrated by a survey conducted for PM in 2000. Thus like other major corporations in trouble, both BAT and PM turned to the concept of CSR. PM has not issued a formal social report, choosing to declare its trouble, both BAT and PM turned to the concept of CSR. PM has not issued a formal social report, choosing to declare its CSR stance.24\\n\\nIndustry Watch\\n\\n\\u201cMore than just a tobacco company\\u201d\\n\\nIn 1997, at the height of lawsuits brought against the tobacco industry by US states attorneys general, PM designed a public relations strategy, \\u201cPM21\\u201d, intended to burnish the company\\u2019s image by stressing its humanitarian and environmental good works: \\u201cPM Advertising Objective: Improve favorability of the Philip Morris Company by showing the American public who we really are\\u2026 Give people reasons to connect with PM on a positive, emotional level.\\u201d25 Then in 1998, the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with the attorneys general provided PM and other major cigarette companies the relief of not having to face dozens of state sponsored lawsuits in exchange for cash, changes in marketing and advertising, and guaranteed release of industry documents. Steven Parrish, senior vice-president corporate affairs, PM Companies, and General Counsel, in a \\u201cmea culpa\\u201d before a Rotary audience in 2001, credited the MSA with prompting the new, socially responsible approach:\\n\\n...my company\\u2019s public reputation has taken quite a pounding over the last decade or so\\u2026we have no one to blame for that but ourselves... Public concerns were mounting over the serious health effects of tobacco use. People were worried about problems like youth smoking... Our response to this shifting social climate was silence and inaction. By refusing to engage in a dialogue with society in an effort to resolve legitimate concerns and solve real problems, we only succeeded in making them worse... The tobacco environment changed dramatically in the U.S. in 1998. The major U.S. tobacco companies...reached a sweeping agreement with the state attorneys general... What\\u2019s truly significant is that it ushered in an era of fundamental and lasting change in the way cigarettes are marketed and sold.26\\n\\nAn outside analyst had warned Parrish in 1999 that the MSA notwithstanding PM\\u2019s company image was still closely linked to the outcome of litigation brought by private citizens, thus to investor confidence and stock price: \\u201cIn the long run, we believe the tobacco industry\\u2019s track record in individual suits is the key to valuation... Anti-tobacco groups have demonized the industry and influenced juries (as witnessed in San Francisco and Oregon) while the industry hid behind closed doors.\\u201d The analyst advised that PM21 should advertise the company \\u201cas being more open and accessible, as working to reduce youth smoking both domestically and internationally, and as being supportive of reasonable solutions to the public policy issues facing cigarette manufacturers\\u201d. Apologies for past behaviour, however, were thought not to be an \\u201ceffective form of communication\\u201d. Instead, PM should highlight all the good all the PM companies did, such as hunger and disaster relief, youth smoking prevention, campaign against domestic violence. PM\\u2019s would be revealed as a \\u201cgood corporate citizen... [M]ore than just a tobacco company.\\u201d27\\n\\nDealing with \\u201cstrategic issues\\u201d\\n\\nGeoffrey Bible recognised that image remake and philanthropy would not be enough; the product\\u2014cigarettes\\u2014was still the main issue. In May 1999 he convened a \\u201cStrategic Issues Task Force\\u201d to consider how the company\\u2019s new web page should explain its \\u201cposition on the subjects of causation, addiction, and Environmental Tobacco Smoke, and whether the Company should disclose ingredient information on the web site, and if so, in what form.\\u201d Such potential statements to the US audience might serve to \\u201cenhance our public communications on various issues that are topical in our domestic tobacco business.\\u201d28 Denise Keane, PM USA senior executive vice-president, and president of Philip Morris Unit, said: \\u201c...we have to live with the fact that the tobacco business may be controversial, but we are principled people who are honest and straight-dealing... That is an absolutely critical part of our corporate culture.\\u201d\\n\\nPM set about to turn Bible\\u2019s private manifesto into a public pronouncement.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nSearch on the PM documents website (www.pmdocs.com) was conducted between February 2003 and May 2004 by reading all papers found under entries to the index term \\u201cfilename\\u201d that appeared relevant to CSR. \\u201cFiles\\u201d are those collections of documents belonging to individuals at PM, and the relevant terms were discovered by the snowball technique, trawling for names of principals in PM responsible for the several initiatives carried out under these headings. The file terms included \\u201cCSR\\u201d, \\u201ccorporate responsibility\\u201d, \\u201ccorporate social responsibility\\u201d, \\u201csocial responsibility\\u201d, \\u201csocial reporting\\u201d, \\u201ccorporate codes\\u201d, \\u201cPM21\\u201d [Philip Morris 21st century], \\u201cstrategic issues task force\\u201d, \\u201cissues management\\u201d, \\u201cPM USA CRT-CWRT [Corporate Responsibility Team, Corporate Responsibility Working Team]\\u201d, \\u201cAltria\\u201d (the new parent name for PM Companies), among others. Several hundred documents reviewed included emails, memoranda, letters, reports (in draft and final forms), presentations and transcripts; exemplars are provided. One useful document written by PM executive staff is a comprehensive 114 page summary of the development of the CSR stance.29\\n\\nFindings: PM CSR development\\n\\nPM has chosen to present itself as an ethical business. In 1996 its CEO Geoffrey Bible defended the company in an address to its employees:\\n\\nI believe passionately that we are right, and let me tell you why. We are right because for millions of people, smoking is part of an adult lifestyle... We are right because cigarettes are a legal product... What some people may not understand is that we are an ethical company. Our tobacco business may be controversial, but we are principled people who are honest and straight-dealing... That is an absolutely critical part of our corporate culture.30\\n\\nPM set about to turn Bible\\u2019s private manifesto into a public pronouncement.\\n\\n\\u2020Contrariwise, there is also a \\u201cvice fund\\u201d for tobacco, alcohol, gambling and weapons corporations\\u2019 shares.

Sometime in 2000 he agreed that there existed a \\u201cglobal regulatory environment\\u201d whose \\u201cgeographic breadth...has critical implications especially for our international tobacco business\\u201d and thus proposed that the Strategic Issues Task Force expand its role beyond a public relations effort to actually develop global company policy around youth smoking prevention, marketing and advertising, product regulation, reduced risk products, and information on the website.\\n\\nCorporate responsibility: using social and environmental issues as a shield against \\u201cwolves at the door\\u201d\\n\\nDavid Nicoli, a member of the task force, was PM\\u2019s vice president for \\u201cissues management\\u201d and \\u201cstrategy and social responsibility.\\u201d He argued that as a global, multi-faceted corporation PM had to be concerned about issues beyond tobacco, such as child labour, human rights, and the necessity to create corporate codes of ethical conduct in order to stave off anti-corporate attacks. Sometime in 2000 he wrote a long memorandum to Steve Parrish and Charles Wall (vice president for litigation and Deputy General Counsel PM Companies) asking for a new corporation wide task force to deal with the matter: \\u201cOnly with a systematic and iterative process can the company have a reasonable degree of assurance that it will not be \\u2018blindsided\\u2019 by \\u2018stealth issues\\u2019 that may cause us financial or reputational harm.\\u201d\\n\\nParrish and Wall then wrote to William Webb and Geoffrey Bible, honing the rationale offered by Nicoli to promote CSR as an active defence:\\n\\nWe believe that the Company must become more systematic in managing political and social issues that can impact our business result, shareholder value, corporate reputation, and/or our position in litigation controversies. [W]e believe that \\u201ccorporate issues management\\u201d must now look beyond the wolves at the door on just the tobacco business and begin to deal with the wolves that are likely to come to the door because of the full breadth of our global business... We need to get ahead of the curve on public expectations of a corporation. That will reduce the risks of law suits and improve our standing, when we are sued, as a \\u201cresponsible corporation\\u201d... As a \\u201cleading global consumer products company\\u201d, we need to act like our peers in the evolving area of \\u201ccorporate social responsibility\\u201d. Otherwise, we will stand out as a target and will be vulnerable where we have \\u201cweak links.\\u201d\\n\\nThe promising issues Parrish and Wall identified included ethical trade, labour standards, biotechnology, waste management, and \\u201cresponsible marketing\\u201d. They allowed that \\u201cresponsible marketing\\u201d could not permit double standards, one domestic USA, another international, either in food or tobacco. \\u201cWe all know how explosive these issues can be.\\u201d\\n\\nThe track then diverged. The PM International \\u201cCorporate Issues Project\\u201d looked at corporate matters such as labour standards, commerce and trade, agriculture and environment; and political topics such as tort, health care and campaign finance reforms\\u2014that is, all issues susceptible to legislation and regulation; while PM USA established a \\u201cCorporate Responsibility Taskforce\\u201d to explore developing a social report; the public statement of CSR, on which this paper focuses. The \\u201cdiscovery\\u201d process was largely driven by mid-level managers.\\n\\nCorporate social responsibility: also a means to engage employees\\n\\nThe desire for respect both within and outside the company played a dominant role in all the taskforce\\u2019s deliberations. In an initial meeting in October 2000, the taskforce listed certain outcomes expected of corporate responsibility, including \\u201cCompetitive advantage... We would be one of the \\u2018Top 10\\u2019 most admired companies... More informed employees.\\u201d The team\\u2019s members also addressed certain parlous topics: \\u201cAdmit our mistakes \\u2013 quit \\u2018dancing\\u2019... Our unique issue is the health impact of our product...but also our history and the public\\u2019s perception that we lied to them.\\u201d\\n\\nIn a follow up meeting, several statements addressed the employees\\u2019 role as stakeholders, and their bewilderment:\\n\\nAs far as being ambassadors, it\\u2019s tough because we feel defensive and lack information and understanding of some things we\\u2019re attacked on... Prepare for widespread employee emotional conflict (employees are all over the map). We have to acknowledge that we have a past\\u2014what we do, we don\\u2019t know yet, but there has to be a healing.\\n\\nAt a follow up meeting, the company\\u2019s core mission was elaborated as the preamble to a social responsibility statement:\\n\\nOur goal is to be the most responsible, effective, and respected developer, manufacturer, and marketer of consumer products, especially products intended for adults. Our core business is manufacturing and marketing the best quality tobacco products available to adults who choose to use them.\\n\\nNine goals were outlined, most dealing with stakeholders. Of key importance was Goal 2: \\u201cProtect the rights of adults who choose to smoke while continuing to work to reduce health risks associated with smoking...Reducing the health risks is one of the most important initiatives in the company.\\u201d\\n\\nIn the spring of 2001 the taskforce continued with what was called a \\u201cconversation\\u201d about corporate responsibility and to reshape the statement of goals into final form. Fifty five mid level executives from various divisions of PM USA participated. Unlike the earlier deliberations notes from this session show virtually no concern for the past or doubt. Within a set of \\u201cworking notes\\u201d in preparation for a final presentation to top executives one finds overarching company policies held to closely: \\u201cIt is confirmed that the Revised Goal Statements are consistent with positions the company is taking in litigation.\\u201d\\n\\nIn none of the documents reviewed were the words \\u201cdeath\\u201d or \\u201cmortality\\u201d ever used.\\n\\nAn anonymous PM executive interpreted the recommendations of the taskforce to emphasise the role of stakeholders, and the smoker as the \\u201ckey stakeholder\\u201d:\\nThe corporate responsibility put into operation: the \\u201cgame plan\\u201d\\n\\nTo implement the taskforce recommendations a Corporate Responsibility Team was established in late 2001: 11 senior persons drawn from the compliance, market information, human resources, and corporate responsibility divisions, to make the CSR communications plan operational.

This report explains the theory and process of CSR, and then documents how one company, Philip Morris, created its CSR statement, and the principal corporate reasons for doing so: to restore its battered reputation, maintain employee morale, mitigate future lawsuits, and thereby to increase the value of corporate stock. While many corporations may have similar motives, the result of their social reports may be favourable to the environment and society. This paper concludes that being in the cigarette business, however, is antithetical to CSR.\\n\\nMost major corporations are joining one or several of these Codes, and certain institutional investors, such as public pension funds and universities are under pressure to use the Codes as \\u2018screeners\\u2019 for investment. We need to examine whether PM should or should not sign up to any of these codes. (We may not even been [sic] \\u2018acceptable\\u2019 to some.)\\n\\nIn fact, Karen Daragan of PM Management Corporation (PMMC) and director of social responsibility and corporate issues, asked Sustainable Asset Management, the Swiss social investment partner of the DJSI, to conduct an informal assessment of PM measured against the DJSI criteria, which included several items related to the tobacco industry. She reported to upper management: \\u201cWe did not fill out the DJSI survey. The results were not great for those reasons and others.\\u201d\\n\\nUnlike BAT, PM has not written a formal social report following code criteria, has not signed on to any existing code, or been listed in any social investment portfolio. Instead, the company appears to have taken the written advice of one of its CSR consultants, Business for Social Responsibility, underlined and starred by a PM reader, that many corporations are \\u201cpublishing the information on their Web sites, and some are choosing to only put it on their Web sites.\\u201d The Altria web site contains a message from Karen Daragan (now vice president, strategy and social responsibility, Altria Corporate Services, Inc) that begins:\\n\\n```\\n\\nWhat we within the Altria family of companies call Responsibility goes by many other names around the globe\\u2014Corporate Social Responsibility, Corporate Citizenship, Sustainable Development, or Managing for the Triple Bottom Line. We believe that the name chosen is less important than the core concept.\\n\\nPM USA\\u2019s current web site gives the \\u201cMission & Values\\u201d list as finally decided on in the development of approach to CSR. The site makes statements unimaginable coming from PM just a couple of years ago. It is explicit about the diseases caused by smoking (although without using the words \\u201cdeath\\u201d or \\u201cmortality\\u201d); accepts that \\u201ccigarette smoking\\u201d is addictive (but without mentioning nicotine); and provides detailed lists of ingredients potentially present in all its brands. With respect to passive smoke: \\u201cPhilip Morris USA believes that the public should be guided by the conclusions of public health officials regarding the health effects of secondhand smoke.\\u201d A new web page has been posted in...\\n2004 detailing the research PM scientists have published or presented on harm reduction, cigarette toxicology, and other studies. The PM International website quotes its president and CEO, Andre Calantzopoulos, saying: \\u201c...for us economic performance is not the only measure of our success. Honesty, integrity and social responsibility are just as important to the way we measure ourselves\\u201d; the technical details about smoking and cigarettes scattered about the site closely match PM USA's. In all these sites PM information is more forthcoming than what is present at RJ Reynolds and Japan Tobacco International sites where no claims to CSR are made.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nThe documents reviewed in this paper show how PM developed public statements based on concepts of CSR; it is not unlikely that internal documents of other TNCs espousing CSR would show similar processes. PM executives maintain that their company has always been ethical and responsible, but realised that public relations statements and philanthropy were insufficient to stem the tide of investigation, litigation, internal documents coming to light, diminished employee morale, and eroding share value. Under its own terms, as a corporate entity, PM justifiably used the concept of CSR to maintain its responsibility to its principal stakeholder, the investor; documents aimed at an internal audience are congruent with statements made in public, an unusual finding in documents research. But in its approach to social responsibility, PM also claims that one of its key stakeholders is the \\u201cadult smoker\\u201d who makes the informed choice to smoke; and that the company must defend this right of choice. But here is the dilemma. This corporate entity has a profound and disturbing effect on the public\\u2019s health, with a product that kills half its users, as well as a smaller proportion of non-users exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke. Moreover, the alleged right to choose to smoke is undermined by the company\\u2019s forthright admission that its product is addictive, and made deliberately more so as industry documents show: that the majority of American smokers wish they did not; and, disturbingly, that nearly half the tobacco consumed in the USA is by persons with mental illness. No other major corporation espousing CSR is so burdened. While the literature and case studies on CSR mostly support the positive contributions of major industries to social responsibility, one must conclude that being in the cigarette business is antithetical to CSR.\\n\\nSo, as Kenneth Warner asked: what is a tobacco company to do? By agencies that with respect to CSR, it is seeking to make smoking less hazardous; it wishes to market responsibly to informed, willing adults only; and it is responsive to all its stakeholders, including the scientific and public health communities. Warner, doubting the industry's bona fides, proposed that the tobacco industry be truly responsible by abandoning advertising and promotion, supporting a huge increase in the excise tax, turning youth prevention programmes over to a neutral agency, and accepting effective regulation by the federal government. Most importantly, he called on the industry to cease the \\u201cbald and voracious attempts to expand its market among the world\\u2019s most vulnerable populations\\u201d. In other words, stop behaving like an ordinary free enterprise corporation. PM executives, struggling to improve the company\\u2019s image, actually debated in the early 1990s getting out of the cigarette business altogether, but demurred. It would have been better had they done so.\\n\\nGiven an industry that intends to remain in the cigarette business for the foreseeable future, what are tobacco control advocates to do? They must maintain the pressure for bans on public smoking, higher taxes, counter-marketing, effective regulation, litigation, improved methods of cessation, and for ratification of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Also essential is to caution the public against uncritical acceptance of the tobacco industry\\u2019s mantle of \\u201csocial responsibility\\u201d.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n\\nStella Blalock and Stan Shatenstein provided helpful reviews of the paper in draft.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n1 Crawfomer D, Rayman-Bachus L.

That is while many problems in computer vision inherently have an underlying high-level structure and can benefit from it. Spatio-temporal graphs are a popular tool for imposing such high-level intuitions in the formulation of real world problems. In this paper, we propose an approach for combining the power of high-level spatio-temporal graphs and sequence learning success of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We develop a scalable method for casting an arbitrary spatio-temporal graph as a rich RNN mixture that is feedforward, fully differentiable, and jointly trainable. The proposed method is generic and principled as it can be used for transforming any spatio-temporal graph through employing a certain set of well defined steps. The evaluations of the proposed approach on a diverse set of problems, ranging from modeling human motion to object interactions, shows improvement over the state-of-the-art with a large margin. We expect this method to empower new approaches to problem formulation through high-level spatio-temporal graphs and Recurrent Neural Networks.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nThe world we live in is inherently structured. It is comprised of components that interact with each other in space and time, leading to a spatio-temporal composition. Utilizing such structures in problem formulation allows domain-experts to inject their high-level knowledge in learning frameworks. This has been the incentive for many efforts in computer vision and machine learning, such as Logic Networks [46], Graphical Models [28], and Structured SVMs [26]. Structures that span over both space and time (spatio-temporal) are of particular interest to computer vision and robotics communities. Primarily, interactions between humans and environment in real world are inherently spatio-temporal in nature. For example, during a cooking activity, humans interact with multiple objects both in space and through time. Similarly, parts of human body (arms, legs, etc.) have individual functions but work with each other in concert to generate physically sensible motions. Hence, bringing high-level spatio-temporal structures and rich sequence modeling capabilities together is of particular importance for many applications.\\n\\nThe notable success of RNNs has proven their capability on many end-to-end learning tasks [19, 14, 10, 66]. However, they lack a high-level and intuitive spatio-temporal structure though they have been shown to be successful at modeling long sequences [49, 43, 52]. Therefore, augmenting a high-level structure with learning capability of RNNs leads to a powerful tool that has the best of both worlds. Spatio-temporal graphs (st-graphs) are a popular [39, 37, 4, 11, 32, 65, 22] general tool for representing such high-level spatio-temporal structures. The nodes of the graph typically represent the problem components, and the edges capture their spatio-temporal interactions. To achieve\\nthe above goal, we develop a generic tool for transforming an arbitrary st-graph into a feedforward mixture of RNNs, named structural-RNN (S-RNN). Figure 1 schematically illustrates this process, where a sample spatio-temporal problem is shown at the bottom, the corresponding st-graph representation is shown in the middle, and our RNN mixture counterpart of the st-graph is shown at the top.\\n\\nIn high-level steps, given an arbitrary st-graph, we first roll it out in time and decompose it into a set of contributing factor components. The factors identify the independent components that collectively determine one decision and are derived from both edges and nodes of the st-graph. We then semantically group the factor components and represent each group using one RNN, which results in the desired RNN mixture. The main challenges of this transformation problem are: 1) making the RNN mixture as rich as possible to enable learning complex functions, yet 2) keeping the RNN mixture scalable with respect to size of the input st-graph. In order to make the resulting RNN mixture rich, we liberally represent each spatio-temporal factor (including node factors, temporal edge factors, and spatio-temporal edge factors) using one RNN. On the other hand, to keep the overall mixture scalable but not lose the essential learning capacity, we utilize \\u201cfactor sharing\\u201d (aka clique templates [54, 42, 53]) and allow the factors with similar semantic functions to share an RNN. This results in a rich and scalable feedforward mixture of RNNs that is equivalent to the provided st-graph in terms of input, output, and spatio-temporal relationships. The mixture is also fully differentiable, and therefore, can be trained jointly as one entity.\\n\\nThe proposed method is principled and generic as the transformation is based on a set of well defined steps and it is applicable to any problem that can be formulated as st-graphs (as defined in Section 3). Several previous works have attempted solving specific problems using a collection of RNNs [49, 12, 61, 10, 5], but they are almost unanimously task-specific. They also do not utilize mechanisms similar to factorization or factor sharing in devising their architecture to ensure richness and scalability.\\n\\nS-RNN is also modular, as it is enjoying an underlying high-level structure. This enables easy high-level manipulations which are basically not possible in unstructured (plain-vanilla) RNNs (e.g., we will experimentally show forming a feasible hybrid human motion by mixing parts of different motion styles - Sec 4.2). We evaluate the proposed approach on a diverse set of spatio-temporal problems (human pose modeling and forecasting, human-object interaction, and driver decision making), and show significant improvements over the state of the art on each problem. We also study complexity and convergence properties of S-RNN and provide further experimental insights by visualizing its memory cells that reveals some cells interestingly represent certain semantic operations. The code of the entire framework that accepts a st-graph as the input and yields the output RNN mixture is available at the\\n\\nhttp://asheshjain.org/srnn.\\n\\nThe contribution of this paper are: 1) a generic method for casting an arbitrary st-graph as a rich, scalable, and jointly trainable RNN mixture, 2) in defence of structured approaches, we show S-RNN significantly outperforms its unstructured (plain-vanilla) RNN counterparts, 3) in defence of RNNs, we show on several diverse spatio-temporal problems that modeling structure with S-RNN outperforms the non-deep learning based structured counterparts.\\n\\n2. Related Work\\n\\nWe give a categorized overview of the related literature. In general, three main characteristics differentiate our work from existing techniques: being generic and not restricted to a specific problem, providing a principled method for transforming a st-graph into a scalable rich feedforward RNN mixture, and being jointly trainable.\\n\\n**Spatio-temporal problems.** Problems that require spatial and temporal reasoning are very common in robotics and computer vision. Examples include human activity recognition and segmentation from videos [50, 47, 62, 60, 8, 25, 37, 36], context-rich human-object interactions [39, 33, 29, 20, 30], modeling human motion [14, 57, 56] etc. Spatio-temporal reasoning also finds application in assistive robots, driver understanding, and object recognition [65, 22, 44, 23, 11]. In fact most of our daily activities are spatio-temporal in nature. With growing interests in rich interactions and robotics, this form of reasoning will become even more important. We evaluate our generic method on three context-rich spatio-temporal problems: (i) Human motion modeling [14]; (ii) Human-object interaction understanding [33]; and (iii) Driver maneuver anticipation [22].\\n\\n**Mixtures of deep architectures.** Several previous works build multiple networks and wire them together in order to capture some complex structure (or interactions) in the problem with promising results on applications such as activity detection, scene labeling, image captioning, and object detection [12, 5, 9, 16, 49, 61]. However, such architectures are mostly hand designed for specific problems, though they demonstrate the benefit in using a modular deep architecture. Recursive Neural Networks [17] are, on the other hand, generic feedforward architectures, but for problems with recursive structure such as parsing of natural sentences and scenes [48]. Our work is a remedy for problems expressed as spatio-temporal graphs. For a new spatio-temporal problem in hand, all a practitioner needs to do is to express their intuition about the problem as an st-graph.\\n\\n**Deep learning with graphical models.** Many works have addressed deep networks with graphical models for structured prediction tasks. Bengio et al. [1] combined CNNs with HMM for hand writing recognition. Tompson et al. [58] jointly train CNN and MRF for human pose estimation. Chen et al. [7] use a similar approach for image classification with general MRF. Recently several works\\nhave addressed end-to-end image segmentation with fully connected CRF [66, 41, 15, 40]. Several works follow a two-stage approach and decouple the deep network from CRF. They have been applied to multiple problems including image segmentation, pose estimation, document processing [64, 6, 38, 3] etc. All of these works advocate and well demonstrate the benefit in exploiting the structure in the problem together with rich deep architectures. However, they largely do not address spatio-temporal problems and the proposed architectures are task-specific.\\n\\n**Conditional Random Fields (CRF)** model dependencies between the outputs by learning a joint distribution over them. They have been applied to many applications [34, 13, 45] including st-graphs which are commonly modeled as spatio-temporal CRF [39, 33, 65, 11]. In our approach, we adopt st-graphs as a general graph representation and embody it using an RNN mixture architecture. Unlike CRF, our approach is not probabilistic and is not meant to model the joint distribution over the outputs. S-RNN instead learns the dependencies between the outputs via structural sharing of RNNs between the outputs.\\n\\n### 3. Structural-RNN architectures\\n\\nIn this section we describe our approach for building structural-RNN (S-RNN) architectures. We start with a st-graph, decompose it into a set of factor components, then represent each factor using a RNN. The RNNs are interconnected in a way that the resulting architecture captures the structure and interactions of the st-graph.\\n\\n#### 3.1. Representation of spatio-temporal graphs\\n\\nMany applications that require spatial and temporal reasoning are modeled using st-graphs [4, 11, 33, 65, 22]. We represent a st-graph with $G = (\\\\mathcal{V}, \\\\mathcal{E}_S, \\\\mathcal{E}_T)$, whose structure $(\\\\mathcal{V}, \\\\mathcal{E}_S)$ unrolls over time through edges $\\\\mathcal{E}_T$. Figure 2a shows an example st-graph capturing human-object interactions during an activity. The nodes $v \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}$ and edges $e \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}_S \\\\cup \\\\mathcal{E}_T$ of the st-graph repeats over time. In particular, Figure 2b shows the same st-graph unrolled through time. In the unrolled st-graph, the nodes at a given time step $t$ are connected with undirected spatio-temporal edge $e = (u, v) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}_S$, and the nodes at adjacent time steps (say the node $u$ at time $t$ and the node $v$ at time $t+1$) are connected with undirected temporal edge iff $(u, v) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}_T$.\\n\\nGiven a st-graph and the feature vectors associated with the nodes $x_u$ and edges $x_e$, as shown in Figure 2b, the goal is to predict the node labels (or real value vectors) $y_u^t$ at each time step $t$. For instance, in human-object interaction, the node features can represent the human and object poses, and edge features can represent their relative orientation; the node labels represent the human activity and object affordance. Label $y_u^t$ is affected by both its node and its interactions with other nodes (edges), leading to an overall complex system. Such interactions are commonly parameterized with a factor graph that conveys how a (complicated) function over the st-graph factorizes into simpler functions [35]. We derive our S-RNN architecture from the factor graph representation of the st-graph. Our factor graph representation has a factor function $\\\\Psi(v, x_v)$ for each node and a pairwise factor $\\\\Psi_{(e)}(y_{(1)}, y_{(2)}, x_e)$ for each edge. Figure 2c shows the factor graph corresponding to the st-graph in 2a.\\n\\n**Sharing factors between nodes.** Each factor in the st-graph has parameters that need to be learned. Instead of learning a distinct factor for each node, semantically similar nodes can optionally share factors. For example, all \\u201cobject nodes\\u201d $\\\\{u, v\\\\}$ in the st-graph can share the same node factor and parameters. This modeling choice allows enforcing parameter sharing between similar nodes. It further gives the flexibility to handle st-graphs with more nodes without increasing the number of parameters. For this purpose, we partition the nodes as $C_V = \\\\{V_1, \\\\ldots, V_P\\\\}$ where $V_p$ is a set of semantically similar nodes, and they all use the same node factor $\\\\Psi_{V_p}$. In Figure 3a we re-draw the st-graph and assign same color to the nodes sharing node factors.\\n\\nPartitioning nodes on their semantic meanings leads to a natural semantic partition of the edges, $C_E = \\\\{E_1, \\\\ldots, E_M\\\\}$, where $E_m$ is a set of edges whose nodes form a semantic pair. Therefore, all edges in the set $E_m$ share the same edge factor $\\\\Psi_{E_m}$. For example all \\u201chuman-object\\n\\n---\\n\\n1For simplicity, the example st-graph in Figure 2a considers temporal edges of the form $(v, v) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}_T$.\\n\\n2Note that we adopted factor graph as a tool for capturing interactions and not modeling the overall function. Factor graphs are commonly used in probabilistic graphical models for factorizing joint probability distributions. We consider them for general st-graphs and do not establish relations to its probabilistic and function decomposition properties.\\nedges\\\" \\\\{(v, u), (v, w)\\\\} are modeled with the same edge factor. Sharing factors based on semantic meaning makes the overall parametrization compact. In fact, sharing parameters is necessary to address applications where the number of nodes depends on the context. For example, in human-object interaction the number of object nodes vary with the environment. Therefore, without sharing parameters between the object nodes, the model cannot generalize to new environments with more objects. For modeling flexibility, the edge factors are not shared across the edges in $E_S$ and $E_T$. Hence, in Figure 3a, object-object (w, w) $\\\\in E_T$ temporal edge is colored differently from object-object (u, u) $\\\\in E_S$ spatio-temporal edge.\\n\\nIn order to predict the label of node $v \\\\in V_p$, we consider its node factor $\\\\Psi_{V_p}$, and the edge factors connected to v in the factor graph. We define a node factor and an edge factor as neighbors if they jointly affect the label of some node in the st-graph. More formally, the node factor $\\\\Psi_{V_p}$ and edge factor $\\\\Psi_{E_m}$ are neighbors, if there exist a node $v \\\\in V_p$ such that it connects to both $\\\\Psi_{V_p}$ and $\\\\Psi_{E_m}$ in the factor graph. We will use this definition in building S-RNN architecture such that it captures the interactions in the st-graph.\\n\\n### 3.2. Structural-RNN from spatio-temporal graphs\\n\\nWe derive our S-RNN architecture from the factor graph representation of the st-graph. The factors in the st-graph operate in a temporal manner, where at each time step the factors observe (node & edge) features and perform some computation on those features. In S-RNN, we represent each factor with an RNN. We refer the RNNs obtained from the node factors as nodeRNNs and the RNNs obtained from the edge factors as edgeRNNs. The interactions represented by the st-graph are captured through connections between the nodeRNNs and the edgeRNNs.\\n\\nWe denote the RNNs corresponding to the node factor $\\\\Psi_{V_p}$ and the edge factor $\\\\Psi_{E_m}$ as $V_p$ and $E_m$, respectively. In order to obtain a feedforward network, we connect the edgeRNNs and nodeRNNs to form a bipartite graph $G_R = (\\\\{R_{E_m}\\\\}, \\\\{R_{V_p}\\\\}, E_R)$. In particular, the edgeRNN $E_m$ is connected to the nodeRNN $V_p$ if the factors $E_m$ and $\\\\Psi_{V_p}$ are neighbors in the st-graph, i.e. they jointly affect the label of some node in the st-graph. To summarize, in Algorithm 1 we show the steps for constructing S-RNN architecture. Figure 3b shows the S-RNN for the human activity represented in Figure 3a. The nodeRNNs combine the outputs of the edgeRNNs they are connected to (i.e. its neighbors in the factor graph), and predict the node labels. The predictions of nodeRNNs (eg. $R_{V_p}$) interact through the edgeRNNs (eg. $R_{E_m}$). Each edgeRNN handles a specific semantic interaction between the nodes connected in the st-graph and models how the interactions evolve over time. In the next section, we explain the inputs, outputs, and the training procedure of S-RNN.\\n\\n### 3.3. Training structural-RNN architecture\\n\\nIn order to train the S-RNN architecture, for each node of the st-graph the features associated with the node are fed into the architecture. In the forward-pass for node $v \\\\in V_p$, the input into edgeRNN $E_m$ is the temporal sequence of edge features $x_{e_m}$ on the edge $e \\\\in E_m$, where edge $e$ is incident to node $v$ in the st-graph. The nodeRNN $V_p$ at each time step concatenates the node feature $x_{v}$ and the outputs of edgeRNNs it is connected to, and predicts the node label. At the time of training, the errors in prediction are back-propagated through the nodeRNN and edgeRNNs involved during the forward-pass. That way, S-RNN non-linearly combines the node and edge features associated with the nodes in order to predict the node labels.\\n\\nFigure 3c shows the forward-pass through S-RNN for the human node. Figure 4 shows a detailed architecture lay-\\nout of the same forward-pass. The forward-pass involves the edgeRNNs \\\\( R_{E_1} \\\\) (human-object edge) and \\\\( R_{E_2} \\\\) (human-human edge). Since the human node \\\\( v \\\\) interacts with two object nodes \\\\( \\\\{u, w\\\\} \\\\), we pass the summation of the two edge features as input to \\\\( R_{E_1} \\\\). The summation of features, as opposed to concatenation, is important to handle variable number of object nodes with a fixed architecture. Since the object count varies with environment, it is challenging to represent variable context with a fixed length feature vector. Empirically, adding features works better than mean pooling. We conjecture that addition retains the object count and the structure of the st-graph, while mean pooling averages out the number of edges. The nodeRNN \\\\( R_{V_i} \\\\) concatenates the (human) node features with the outputs from edgeRNNs, and predicts the activity at each time step.\\n\\nParameter sharing and structured feature space. An important aspect of S-RNN is sharing of parameters across the node labels. Parameter sharing between node labels happen when an RNN is common in their forward-pass. For example in Figure 3c and 3d, the edgeRNN \\\\( R_{E_1} \\\\) is common in the forward-pass for the human node and the object nodes. Furthermore, the parameters of \\\\( R_{E_1} \\\\) gets updated through back-propagated gradients from both the object and human nodeRNNs. In this way, \\\\( R_{E_1} \\\\) affects both the human and object node labels.\\n\\nSince the human node is connected to multiple object nodes, the input into edgeRNN \\\\( R_{E_1} \\\\) is always a linear combination of human-object edge features. This imposes an structure on the features processed by \\\\( R_{E_1} \\\\). More formally, the input into \\\\( R_{E_1} \\\\) is the inner product \\\\( s^T F \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is the feature matrix storing the edge features \\\\( x_e, s.t., e \\\\in E_1 \\\\). Vector \\\\( s \\\\) captures the structured feature space. Its entries are in \\\\( \\\\{0,1\\\\} \\\\) depending on the node being forward-passed. In the example above \\\\( F = [x_{v,u}, x_{v,w}]^T \\\\). For the human node \\\\( v \\\\), \\\\( s = [1 \\\\ 1]^T \\\\), while for the object node \\\\( u \\\\), \\\\( s = [1 \\\\ 0]^T \\\\).\\n\\n4. Experiment\\n\\nWe present results on three diverse spatio-temporal problems to ensure generic applicability of S-RNN, shown in Figure 5. The applications include: (i) modeling human motion [14] from motion capture data [21]; (ii) human activity detection and anticipation [29, 31]; and (iii) maneuver anticipation from real-world driving data [22].\\n\\n4.1. Human motion modeling and forecasting\\n\\nHuman body is a good example of separate but well related components. Its motion involves complex spatio-temporal interactions between the components (arms, legs, spine), resulting in sensible motion styles like walking, eating etc. In this experiment, we represent the complex motion of humans over st-graphs and learn to model them with S-RNN. We show that our structured approach outperforms the state-of-the-art unstructured deep architecture [14] on motion forecasting from motion capture (mocap) data. Several approaches based on Gaussian processes [59, 63], Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) [57, 56, 51], and RNNs [14] have been proposed to model human motion. Recently, Fragkiadaki et al. [14] proposed an encoder-RNN-decoder (ERD) which gets state-of-the-art forecasting results on H3.6m mocap data set [21].\\n\\nS-RNN architecture for human motion. Our S-RNN architecture follows the st-graph shown in Figure 5a. According to the st-graph, the spine interacts with all the body parts, and the arms and legs interact with each other. The st-graph is automatically transformed to S-RNN following Section 3.2. The resulting S-RNN have three nodeRNNs, one for each type of body part (spine, arm, and leg), four edgeRNNs for modeling the spatio-temporal interactions between them, and three edgeRNNs for their temporal connections. For edgeRNNs and nodeRNNs we use FC(256)-FC(256)-LSTM(512) and LSTM(512)-FC(256)-FC(100)-FC(\\\\cdot) architectures, respectively, with skip input and output connections [18]. The outputs of nodeRNNs are skeleton joints of different body parts, which are concatenated to reconstruct the complete skeleton. In order to model human motion, we train S-RNN to predict the mocap frame at time \\\\( t + 1 \\\\) given the frame at time \\\\( t \\\\). Similar to [14], we gradually add noise to the mocap frames during training. This simulates curriculum learning [2] and helps in keeping the forecasted motion close to the manifold of human motion. As node features we use the raw joint values expressed as exponential map [14], and edge features are concatenation.\\nof the node features. We train all RNNs jointly to minimize the Euclidean loss between the predicted mocap frame and the ground truth. See supplementary material on the project web page [24] for training details.\\n\\nEvaluation setup. We compare S-RNN with the state-of-the-art ERD architecture [14] on H3.6m mocap data set [21]. We also compare with a 3 layer LSTM architecture (LSTM-3LR) which [14] use as a baseline. For motion forecasting we follow the experimental setup of [14]. We downsample H3.6m by two and train on 6 subjects and test on subject S5. To forecast, we first feed the architectures with (50) seed mocap frames, and then forecast the future (100) frames. Following [14], we consider walking, eating, and smoking activities. In addition to these three, we also consider discussion activity.\\n\\nForecasting is specially challenging on activities with complex aperiodic human motion. In H3.6m data set, significant parts of eating, smoking, and discussion activities are aperiodic, while walking activity is mostly periodic. Our evaluation demonstrates the benefits of having an underlying structure in three important ways: (i) We present visualizations and quantitative results on complex aperiodic activities ([14] evaluates only on periodic walking motion); (ii) We forecast human motion for almost twice longer than state-of-the-art [14]. This is very challenging for aperiodic activities; and finally (iii) We show S-RNN interestingly learns semantic concepts, and demonstrate its modularity by generating hybrid human motion. Unstructured deep architectures like [14] does not offer such modularity.\\n\\n**Qualitative results on motion forecasting.** Figure 6 shows forecasting 1000ms of human motion on \\u201ceating\\u201d activity \\u2013 the subject drinks while walking. S-RNN stays close to the ground-truth in the short-term and generates human like motion in the long-term. On removing edgeRNNs, the skeleton freezes to some mean position. LSTM-3LR suffers from a drifting problem. On many test examples it drifts to the mean position of walking human ([14] made similar observations about LSTM-3LR). The motion generated by ERD [14] stays human-like in the short-term but it drifts away to non-human like motion in the long-term. This was a common outcome of ERD on complex aperiodic activities, unlike S-RNN. Furthermore, ERD produced human motion was non-smooth on many test examples. See the video on the project web page for more examples [24].\\n\\n**Quantitative evaluation.** We follow the evaluation metric of Fragkiadaki et al. [14] and present the 3D angle error between the forecasted mocap frame and the ground truth in Table 1. Qualitatively, ERD models human motion better than LSTM-3LR. However, in the short-term, it does not mimic the ground-truth as well as LSTM-3LR. Fragkiadaki et al. [14] also note this trade-off between ERD and LSTM-3LR. On the other hand, S-RNN outperforms both LSTM-3LR and ERD on short-term motion forecasting on all activities. S-RNN therefore mimics the ground truth in the short-term and generates human like motion in the long term. In this way it well handles both short and long term forecasting. Due to stochasticity in human motion, long-term forecasts (> 500ms) can significantly differ from the ground truth but still depict human-like motion. For this reason, the long-term forecast numbers in Table 1 are not a fair representative of algorithms modeling capabilities. We also observe that discussion is one of the most challenging activities, unlike S-RNN. Furthermore, ERD produced human motion was non-smooth on many test examples. See the video on the project web page for more examples [24].\\n\\n**Table 1: Motion forecasting angle error.** \\n\\n| Methods  | Short-term forecast | Long-term forecast |\\n|----------|---------------------|--------------------|\\n|          | 80ms (80)          | 160ms (160)        |\\n|          | 320ms (320)        | 560ms (560)        |\\n| Walking activity | 1000ms (1000) |                     |\\n| ERD [14] | 1.30 1.56 1.84     | 2.00 2.38          |\\n| LSTM-3LR | 1.18 1.50 1.67     | 1.81 2.20          |\\n| S-RNN   | 1.08 1.34 1.60     | 1.90 2.13          |\\n| Eating activity | 1.36 1.79 2.29 |                     |\\n| ERD [14] | 1.16 1.93 2.28     | 2.36 2.41          |\\n| LSTM-3LR | 1.36 1.79 2.29     | 2.49 2.82          |\\n| S-RNN   | 1.35 1.71 2.12     | 2.28 2.58          |\\n| Smoking activity | 1.90 2.30 2.90 |                     |\\n| ERD [14] | 2.54 2.74 3.73     | 3.68 3.82          |\\n| LSTM-3LR | 2.05 2.34 3.10     | 3.24 3.42          |\\n| S-RNN   | 1.90 2.30 2.90     | 3.21 3.23          |\\n| Discussion activity | 1.67 2.03 2.39 |                     |\\n| ERD [14] | 2.67 2.97 3.23     | 3.47 2.92          |\\n| LSTM-3LR | 2.25 2.33 2.45     | 2.48 2.93          |\\n| S-RNN   | 1.67 2.03 2.39     | 2.39 2.43          |\\naperiodic activity for all algorithms.\\n\\nUser study. We asked users to rate the motions on a Likert scale of 1 to 3. S-RNN performed best according to the user study. See supplementary material for the results.\\n\\nTo summarize, unstructured approaches like LSTM-3LR and ERD struggles to model long-term human motion on complex activities. S-RNN\\u2019s good performance is attributed to its structural modeling of human motion through the underlying st-graph. S-RNN models each body part separately with nodeRNNs and captures interactions between them with edgeRNNs in order to produce coherent motions.\\n\\n4.2. Going deeper into structural-RNN\\n\\nWe now present several insights into S-RNN architecture and demonstrate the modularity of the architecture which enables it to generate hybrid human motions.\\n\\nVisualization of memory cells. We investigated if S-RNN memory cells represent meaningful semantic sub-motions. Semantic cells were earlier studied on other problems [27], we are the first to present it on a vision task and human motion. In Figure 7 (left) we show a cell in the leg nodeRNN learns the semantic motion of moving the leg forward. The cell fires positive (red color) on the forward movement of the leg and negative (blue color) on its backward movement. As the subject walks, the cell alternately fires for the right and the left leg. Longer activations in the right leg corresponds to the longer steps taken by the subject with the right leg. Similarly, a cell in the arm nodeRNN learns the concept of moving hand close to the face, as shown in Figure 7 (right). The same cell fires whenever the subject moves the hand closer to the face during eating or smoking. The cell remains active as long as the hand stays close to the face. See the video [24].\\n\\nGenerating hybrid human motion. We now demonstrate the flexibility of our modular architecture by generating novel yet meaningful motions which are not in the data set. Such modularity is of interest and has been explored to generate diverse motion styles [55]. As a result of having an underlying high-level structure, our approach allows us to exchange RNNs between the S-RNN architectures trained on different motion styles. We leverage this to create a novel S-RNN architecture which generates a hybrid motion of a human jumping forward on one leg, as shown in Figure 8 (Left). For this experiment we modeled the left and right leg with different nodeRNNs. We trained two independent S-RNN models \\u2013 a slower human and a faster human (by down sampling data) \\u2013 and swapped the left leg nodeRNN of the trained models. The resulting faster human, with a slower left leg, jumps forward on the left leg to keep up with its twice faster right leg. Unstructured architectures like ERD [14] does not offer this kind of flexibility.\\n\\nFigure 8 (Right) examines the test and train error with iterations. Both S-RNN and ERD converge to similar training error, however S-RNN generalizes better with a smaller test error for next step prediction. Discussion in supplementary.\\n\\n4.3. Human activity detection and anticipation\\n\\nIn this section we present S-RNN for modeling human activities. We consider the CAD-120 [29] data set where the activities involve rich human-object interactions. Each activity consist of a sequence of sub-activities (e.g. moving, drinking etc.) and objects affordance (e.g., reachable, drinkable etc.), which evolves as the activity progresses. Detecting and anticipating the sub-activities and affordance enables personal robots to assist humans. However, the problem is challenging as it involves complex interactions \\u2013 humans interact with multiple objects during an activity, and objects also interact with each other (e.g. pouring water from \\u201cglass\\u201d into a \\u201ccontainer\\u201d), which makes it a particularly good fit for evaluating our method. Koppula et al. [31, 29] represents such rich spatio-temporal interactions with the st-graph shown in Figure 5b, and models it with a spatio-temporal CRF. In this experiment, we show that modeling the same st-graph with S-RNN yields superior results. We use the node and edges features from [29].\\n\\nFigure 3b shows our S-RNN architecture to model the st-graph. Since the number of objects varies with environment, factor sharing between the object nodes and the human-object edges becomes crucial. In S-RNN, $R_{V_{t}}$ and $R_{E_{t}}$ handles all the object nodes and the human-object edges respectively. This allows our fixed S-RNN architecture to handle varying size st-graphs. For edgeRNNs we use a single layer LSTM of size 128, and for nodeRNNs we use LSTM(256)-softmax(.). At each time step, the human nodeRNN outputs the sub-activity label (10 classes), and the object nodeRNN outputs the affordance (12 classes).\\n\\nImagine your motion forward if someone holds your right leg and runs!\\nHaving observed the st-graph upto time $t$, the goal is to detect the sub-activity and affordance labels at the current time $t$, and also anticipate their future labels of the time step $t+1$. For detection we train S-RNN on the labels of the current time step. For anticipation we train the architecture to predict the labels of the next time step, given the observations upto the current time. We also train a multi-task version of S-RNN, where we add two softmax layers to each nodeRNN and jointly train for anticipation and detection.\\n\\nTable 3 shows the detection and anticipation F1-scores averaged over all the classes. S-RNN significantly improves over Koppula et al. on both anticipation [31] and detection [29]. On anticipating object affordance S-RNN F1-score is 44% more than [31], and 7% more on detection. S-RNN does not have any Markov assumptions like spatio-temporal CRF, and therefore, it better models the long-time dependencies needed for anticipation. The table also shows the importance of edgeRNNs in handling spatio-temporal components. EdgeRNN transfers the information from the human to objects, which helps in predicting the object labels. Therefore, S-RNN without the edgeRNNs poorly models the objects. This signifies the importance of edgeRNNs and also validates our design. Finally, training S-RNN in a multi-task manner works best in majority of the cases. In Figure 9 we show the visualization of an eating activity. We show one representative frame from each sub-activity and our corresponding predictions.\\n\\n**S-RNN complexity.** In terms of complexity, we discuss two aspects as a function of the underlying st-graph: (i) the number of RNNs in the mixture; and (ii) the complexity of forward-pass. The number of RNNs depends on the number of semantically similar nodes in the st-graph. The overall S-RNN architecture is compact because the edgeRNNs are shared between the nodeRNNs, and the number of semantic categories are usually few in context-rich applications. Furthermore, because of factor sharing the number of RNNs does not increase if more semantically similar nodes are added to the st-graph. The forward-pass complexity is scalable and applicable to any problem expressed over factor graphs\\n\\n5We acknowledge NRI #1426452, ONR-N00014-14-1-0156, MURI-WF911NF-15-1-0479 and Panasonic Center grant #122282.\\n\\n4.4. Driver maneuver anticipation\\n\\nWe finally present S-RNN for another application which involves anticipating maneuvers several seconds before they happen. Jain et al. [22] represent this problem with the st-graph shown in Figure 5c. They model the st-graph as a probabilistic Bayesian network (AIO-HMM [22]). The st-graph represents the interactions between the observations outside the vehicle (eg. the road features), the driver\\u2019s maneuvers, and the observations inside the vehicle (eg. the driver\\u2019s facial features). We model the same st-graph with S-RNN architecture using the node and edge features from Jain et al. [22]. Table 2 shows the performance of different algorithms on this task. S-RNN performs better than the state-of-the-art AIO-HMM [22] in every setting. See supplementary material for the discussion and details [24].\\n\\n5Conclusion\\n\\nWe proposed a generic and principled approach for combining high-level spatio-temporal graphs with sequence modeling success of RNNs. We make use of factor graph, and factor sharing in order to obtain an RNN mixture that is scalable and applicable to any problem expressed over st-graphs. Our RNN mixture captures the rich interactions in the underlying st-graph. We demonstrated significant improvements with S-RNN on three diverse spatio-temporal problems including: (i) human motion modeling; (ii) human-object interaction; and (iii) driver maneuver anticipation. By visualizing the memory cells we showed that S-RNN learns certain semantic sub-motions, and demonstrated its modularity by generating novel human motion.\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] Y. Bengio, Y.

It is also an introduction to the first significant proof technique we will see. As we describe below, this chapter is meant to be an appetizer, a first taste, of what mathematical induction is and how to use it. A couple of chapters from now, we will be able to rigorously define induction and prove that this technique is mathematically valid. That\\u2019s right, we\\u2019ll actually prove how and why it works! For now, though, we\\u2019ll continue our investigation of some interesting mathematical puzzles, with these particular problems hand-picked by us for their use of inductive techniques.\\n\\n2.1.1 Objectives\\n\\nThe following short sections in this introduction will show you how this chapter fits into the scheme of the book. They will describe how our previous work will be helpful, they will motivate why we would care to investigate the topics that appear in this chapter, and they will tell you our goals and what you should keep in mind while reading along to achieve those goals. Right now, we will summarize the main objectives of this chapter for you via a series of statements. These describe the skills and knowledge you should have gained by the conclusion of this chapter. The following sections will reiterate these ideas in more detail, but this will provide you with a brief list for future reference. When you finish working through this chapter, return to this list and see if you understand all of these objectives. Do you see why we outlined them here as being important? Can you define all the terminology we use? Can you apply the techniques we describe?\\nCHAPTER 2. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION\\n\\nBy the end of this chapter, you should be able to . . .\\n\\n\\u2022 Define what an inductive argument is, as well as classify a presented argument as an inductive one or not.\\n\\n\\u2022 Decide when to use an inductive argument, depending on the structure of the problem you are solving.\\n\\n\\u2022 Heuristically describe mathematical induction via an analogy.\\n\\n\\u2022 Identify and describe different kinds of inductive arguments by comparing and contrasting them, as well as identify the underlying structures of the corresponding problems that would yield these similarities and differences.\\n\\n2.1.2 Segue from previous chapter\\n\\nAs in the previous chapter, we won\\u2019t assume any familiarity with more advanced mathematics beyond basic algebra and arithmetic, and perhaps some visual, geometric intuition. We will, however, make use of summation and product notation fairly often, so if you feel like your notational skills are, go back and review Section 1.3.5.\\n\\n2.1.3 Motivation\\n\\nLook back at the Puzzle in Section 1.4.3, where we proved that the sum of the first $n$ odd natural numbers is exactly $n^2$. We first observed this pattern geometrically, by arranging the terms of the sums (odd integers) as successively larger \\u201ccorner pieces\\u201d of a square. The first way we proved the result, though, didn\\u2019t seem to depend on that observation and merely utilized a previous result (about sums of even and odd integers) in an algebraic way; that is, we did some tricky manipulation of some equations (multiplying and subtracting and what have you) and then\\u2014voil\\u00e0!\\u2014out popped the result we expected. What did you think about that approach? Did it feel satisfying? In a way, it didn\\u2019t quite match the geometric interpretation we had, at first, so it might be surprising that it worked out so nicely. (Perhaps there is a different geometric interpretation of this approach. Can you find one?)\\n\\nOur second approach was to model that initial geometric observation. We transformed visual pieces into algebraic pieces; specifically, a sum was related to the area of a square, and the terms of the sum were related to particular pieces of that square. We established a correspondence between different interpretations of the same problem, finding a way to relate one to the other so that we could work with either interpretation and know that we were proving something about the overall result. The benefit of the visual interpretation is that it allowed us to take advantage of a general proof strategy known as mathematical induction, or sometimes just induction, for short. (The word induction has some non-mathematical meanings, as well, such as in electromagnetism or in philosophical arguments, but within the context of this book, when we say induction, we mean\\nWhat exactly is induction? How does it work? When can we use this strategy? How do we adapt the strategy to a particular puzzle? Are there variations of the strategy that are more useful in certain situations? These are all questions that we hope to answer in this chapter.\\n\\nThe first topic we\\u2019d like to address is a question that we didn\\u2019t just ask in the last paragraph, namely, \\u201cWhy induction? Why bother with it?\\u201d Based on that puzzle in Section 1.4.3, it would seem that mathematical induction isn\\u2019t entirely necessary since there might be other ways of proving something, instead of by induction. Depending on the context, this very well may be true, but the point we\\u2019d like to make clear from the beginning is that induction is incredibly useful! There are many situations where a proof by induction is the most concise and clear approach, and it is a well-known general strategy that can be applied in a variety of such situations. Furthermore, applying induction to a problem requires there to be a certain structure to the problem, a dependence of one \\u201cpart\\u201d of the result on a \\u201cprevious part\\u201d. (The \\u201cparts\\u201d and the \\u201cdependence\\u201d will depend on the context, of course.) Recognizing that induction applies, and actually going through the subsequent proof process, will usually teach us something about the inherent structure of the problem. This is true even when induction fails! Perhaps there\\u2019s a particular part of a problem that \\u201cruins\\u201d the induction process, and identifying that particular part can be helpful and insightful.\\n\\nWe hope to motivate these points through some illustrative examples first, after which we will provide a reasonably thorough definition of mathematical induction that will show how the method works, in generality. (A completely rigorous definition will have to be put off until a little bit later, after we have defined and investigated some relevant concepts, like set theory and logical statements and implications. For now, though, the definition we give will suffice to work on some interesting puzzles and allow us to discuss induction as a general proof strategy.)\\n\\n\\\\section*{2.1.4 Goals and Warnings for the Reader}\\n\\nDo keep in mind that we are still building towards our goal of mathematical rigor, or as much as is possible within the scope and timing of this book and course. Some of the claims we make in this Chapter will be clarified and technically proven later on, once we have properly discussed the natural numbers and some basic mathematical logic. All in due time!\\n\\nThat said, this chapter is still very important, since we are continuing to introduce you to the process of solving mathematical problems, applying our existing knowledge and techniques to discover new facts and explain them to others. In addition, mathematical induction is a fundamental proof technique that will likely appear in every other mathematics course you take! This is because of its usefulness and the prevalence of inductive properties throughout the mathematical world.\\n2.2 Examples and Discussion\\n\\n2.2.1 Turning Cubes Into Bigger Cubes\\n\\nTo motivate the overall method of mathematical induction, let\\u2019s examine a geometric puzzle and solve it together. This example has been chosen carefully to illustrate how mathematical induction is relevant when a puzzle has a particular type of structure; specifically, some truth or fact or observation depends or relies or can be derived from a \\u201cprevious\\u201d fact. This dependence on a previous case (or cases) is what makes a process inductive, and when we observe this phenomenon, applying induction is almost always a good idea.\\n\\n1-Cube into a 2-Cube\\n\\nLet\\u2019s examine cubic numbers and, specifically, let\\u2019s try to describe a cubic number in terms of the previous cubic number. Imagine a $1 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1$ cube, just one building block. How can we build the \\u201cnext biggest\\u201d cube, of size $2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2$, by adding $1 \\\\times 1 \\\\times 1$ building blocks? How many do we need to add? Arithmetically, we know the answer: $2^3 = 8$ and $1^3 = 1$, so we need to add 7 blocks to have the correct volume. Okay, that\\u2019s a specific answer, but it doesn\\u2019t quite tell us how to arrange those 7 blocks to make a cube, nor does it give us any insight into how to answer this question for larger cubes. Ultimately, we would like to say how many blocks are required to build a $100 \\\\times 100 \\\\times 100$ cube into a $101 \\\\times 101 \\\\times 101$ cube without having to perform a lot of tedious arithmetic; that is, we are hoping to eventually find an answer to the question: given an $n \\\\times n \\\\times n$ cube, how many blocks must we add to build it into a $(n+1) \\\\times (n+1) \\\\times (n+1)$ cube? With that in mind, let\\u2019s think carefully about this initial case and try to answer it with a general argument.\\n\\nGiven that single building block, and knowing we have to add 7 blocks to it, let\\u2019s try to identify exactly where those 7 blocks should be placed to make a $2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2$ cube. (For simplicity, we will refer to a cube of size $n \\\\times n \\\\times n$ as an $n$-cube, for any value of $n$. We will only need to use values of $n$ that are natural numbers, i.e. non-negative whole numbers, in this example.) Look at the pictures of the 1-cube and 2-cube below and try to come up with an explanation of constructing one from the other.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s one reasonable explanation that we want to use because it will guide us in the general explanation of building an $(n+1)$-cube from an $n$-cube, and because\\nit is a mathematically *elegant* and simple explanation. Start with the 1-cube positioned as it is above and \\u201cenlarge\\u201d the 3 exposed faces by the appropriate amount, in this case by one block. This accounts for 3 of the 7 blocks, thus far: \\\\( 2^3 = 1^3 + 3 + \\\\_\\\\_ \\\\). Where are there \\u201choles\\u201d now?\\n\\n![Image showing the construction process](image)\\n\\nThe blocks we just added have created \\u201cgaps\\u201d between each pair of them, and each of those \\u201cgaps\\u201d can be filled with one block. This accounts for 3 more of the 7 total blocks: \\\\( 2^3 = 1^3 + 3 + 3 + \\\\_\\\\_ \\\\). Now what?\\n\\n![Image showing the construction process](image)\\n\\nThere is just one block left to be filled, and it\\u2019s the very top corner. Adding this block completes the 2-cube and tells us how to mathematically describe our construction process with the following picture and equation:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n2^3 = 1 + 3 + 3 + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\n**2-Cube into a 3-Cube**\\n\\nOkay, we might now have a better idea of how to describe this process in general, but let\\u2019s examine another case or two just to make sure we have the full idea.\\nLet\\u2019s start with a 2-cube and construct a 3-cube from it. (You can even try this out by hand if you happen to own various sizes of Rubik\\u2019s Cubes!) We can follow a process similar to the steps we used in the previous case and just change the numbers appropriately. Starting with a similar picture\\n\\nwe see that we need to \\u201cenlarge\\u201d the three exposed faces of the 2-cube but, in this case, the amount by which we need to enlarge them is different than before (with the 1-cube) since we are working with a larger initial cube. Specifically, each face must be enlarged by a $2 \\\\times 2$ square of blocks (whereas, in the previous case, we added a $1 \\\\times 1$ square of blocks). Thus, an equation to account for this addition is\\n\\n$$3^3 = 2^3 + 3 \\\\cdot 2^2 + \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_$$\\n\\nAfter we do this, we see that we need to fill in the gaps between those enlarged faces with $2 \\\\times 1$ of blocks (whereas, in the previous case, we added $1 \\\\times 1$ rows of blocks). An equation to account for the additions thus far is\\n\\n$$3^3 = 2^3 + 3 \\\\cdot 2^2 + 3 \\\\cdot 2 + \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_$$\\nAfter we do this, we see that there is only the top corner left to fill in. Accordingly, we can depict our construction process and its corresponding equation:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n3^3 = 2^3 + 3 \\\\cdot 2^2 + 3 \\\\cdot 2 + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\n**n-Cube into an** \\\\((n + 1)\\\\)-**Cube**\\n\\nDo you see now how this process will generalize? What if we started with an \\\\(n\\\\)-cube? How could we construct an \\\\((n + 1)\\\\)-cube? Let\\u2019s follow the same steps we used in the previous two cases. First, we would enlarge the three exposed faces by adding three *squares* of blocks. How big is each square? Well, we want each square to be the same size as the exposed faces, so they will be \\\\(n \\\\times n\\\\) squares, accounting for \\\\(n^2\\\\) blocks for each face:\\n(n + 1)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 + __\\n\\nNext, we would fill in the gaps between these enlarged faces with rows of blocks. How long are those rows? Well, they each lie along the edges of the squares of blocks we just added, so they will each be of size \\\\( n \\\\times 1 \\\\), accounting for \\\\( n \\\\) blocks for each gap:\\n\\nFinally, there will only be the top corner left to fill in! Therefore,\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(n + 1)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\u201cWait a minute!\\u201d you might say, abruptly. \\u201cWe already knew that, right?\\u201d In a way, yes; the equation above is an algebraic identity that we can also easily see by just expanding the product on the left and collecting terms:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(n + 1)^3 = (n + 1) \\\\cdot (n + 1)^2 \\\\\\\\\\n= (n + 1) \\\\cdot (n^2 + 2n + 1) \\\\\\\\\\n= (n^3 + 2n^2 + n) + (n^2 + 2n + 1) \\\\\\\\\\n= n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSo what have we really accomplished? Well, the main point behind deriving this identity in this geometric and visual way is that it exhibits how this identity represents some kind of inductive process. We sought to explain how to derive one \\u201cfact\\u201d (a cubic number, \\\\( (n + 1)^3 \\\\)) from a previously known \\u201cfact\\u201d (the next smallest cubic number, \\\\( n^3 \\\\)) and properly explained how to do just that. Compare this to one of the methods we used to investigate the fact that the sums of odd integers yield perfect squares, too. That observation also belies an\\ninductive process and, although we didn\\u2019t describe it as such at the time, we encourage you to think about that now. Look back at our discussion and try to write out how you could write \\\\((n+1)^2\\\\) in terms of \\\\(n^2\\\\) by looking at squares of blocks. Does it look anything like an \\u201cobvious\\u201d algebraic identity? (If you\\u2019re feeling ambitious, think about what happens with writing \\\\((n+1)^4\\\\) in terms of \\\\(n^4\\\\). Is there any geometric intuition behind this? What about higher powers?)\\n\\nThe benefit of the method we\\u2019ve used is that we now know how to describe cubic numbers in terms of smaller cubic numbers, all the way down to \\\\(1\\\\); that is, any time we see a cubic number in an expression, we know precisely how to write that value in terms of a smaller cubic number and some leftover terms. Furthermore, each of those expressions and leftover terms have an inherent structure to them that depends on the cubic number in question. Thus, by iteratively replacing any cubic number, like \\\\((n+1)^3\\\\), with an expression like the one we derived above, and continuing until we can\\u2019t replace any more, should produce an equation that has some built in symmetry. This idea is best illustrated by actually doing it, so let\\u2019s see what happens. Let\\u2019s start with the expression we derived, for some arbitrary value of \\\\(n\\\\),\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(n + 1)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand then recognize that we now know a similar expression\\n\\n\\\\[\\nn^3 = (n-1)^3 + 3(n-1)^2 + 3(n-1) + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe proved that this equation holds when we gave a general argument for the expression above for \\\\(n^3\\\\), since that only relied on the fact that \\\\(n \\\\geq 1\\\\). We can follow the same logical steps, throughout replacing \\\\(n\\\\) with \\\\(n - 1\\\\), and end up with the second expression above, for \\\\((n-1)^3\\\\). (Does this keep going, for any value of \\\\(n\\\\)? Think about this for a minute. Does our argument make any sense when \\\\(n \\\\leq 0\\\\)? Would it make physical sense to talk about, say, constructing a \\\\((-2) \\\\times (-2) \\\\times (-2)\\\\) cube from a different cube?)\\n\\nTherefore, we can replace the \\\\(n^3\\\\) term in the line above\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(n + 1)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n+ (n - 1)^3 + 3(n - 1)^2 + 3(n - 1) + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis is also an algebraic identity, but it\\u2019s certainly not one that we would easily think to write down just by expanding the product on the left-hand side and grouping terms. Here, we are taking advantage of the structure of our result to apply it over and over and obtain new expressions that we wouldn\\u2019t have otherwise thought to write down. Let\\u2019s continue with this substitution process and see where it takes us! Next, we replace \\\\((n-1)^3\\\\) with the corresponding expression and find\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(n + 1)^3 = (n-1)^3 + 3(n-1)^2 + 3(n-1) + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n+ (n - 2)^3 + 3(n - 2)^2 + 3(n - 2) + 1\\n\\\\]\\nPerhaps you see where this is going? We can do this substitution process over and over, and the columns that we\\u2019ve arranged above will continue to grow, showing us that there is something deep and mathematically symmetric going on here. But where does this process stop? We want to write down a concise version of this iterative process and be able to explain all of the terms that arise, so we need to know where it ends. Remember the very first step in our investigation of the cubic numbers? We figured out how to write $2^3 = 1^3 + 3 + 3 + 1$. Since this was our first step in building this inductive process, it should be the last step we apply when building backwards, as we are now. Accordingly, we can write\\n\\n$$(n + 1)^3 = \\\\begin{array}{cccc}\\n3n^2 & + & 3n & + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n+ & 3(n - 1)^2 & + & 3(n - 1) & + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n+ & 3(n - 2)^2 & + & 3(n - 2) & + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n+ & 3(n - 3)^2 & + & 3(n - 3) & + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\vdots & + & \\\\vdots & + & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\n+ & 3 \\\\cdot 2^2 & + & 3 \\\\cdot 2 & + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n+ & 3 \\\\cdot 1^2 & + & 3 \\\\cdot 1 & + 1\\n\\\\end{array}$$\\n\\nThis is definitely an identity we wouldn\\u2019t have come up with off the top of our heads! In addition to being relatively pretty-looking on the page like this, it also allows us to apply some of our previous knowledge and simplify the expression. To see how we can do that, let\\u2019s apply summation notation to the columns above and collect a bunch of terms into some simple expressions:\\n\\n$$(n + 1)^3 = 1^3 + 3 \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 + 3 \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} 1$$\\n\\nIn the last chapter, we saw a couple of different proofs that told us\\n\\n$$\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$$\\n\\nLet\\u2019s use that fact in the line above, and also simplify the term on the far right, to write\\n\\n$$(n + 1)^3 = 1 + 3 \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 + \\\\frac{3n(n + 1)}{2} + n$$\\n\\nWhat does this tell us? What have we accomplished after all this algebraic manipulation? Well, we previously proved a result about the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers, so a natural question to ask after that is: What is the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers squared? How could we begin to answer that? That\\u2019s a trick question, because we already have! Let\\u2019s do one or two more algebraic steps with the equation above by isolating the summation term and\\nthen dividing:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(n + 1)^3 - 1 - n - \\\\frac{3n(n + 1)}{2} = 3 \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{1}{3} (n + 1)^3 - \\\\frac{1}{3} (n + 1) - \\\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis is what we\\u2019ve accomplished: we\\u2019ve derived a formula for the sum of the first \\\\( n \\\\) square natural numbers! Of course, the expression on the left in the line above isn\\u2019t particularly nice looking and we could perform some further simplification, and we will leave it to you to verify that this yields the expression below:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6} n(n + 1)(2n + 1)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\u201cAnd so on\\u201d is not rigorous!\\n\\nThere are a couple of \\u201cmorals\\u201d that we\\u2019d like to point out, based on all of this work. The first moral is that generalizing an argument is a good method for discovering new and interesting mathematical ideas and results. Did you think about how this puzzle is related to the sums of odd natural numbers? If not, we encourage you strongly to try that now, as well as think about generalizing this even further to four or five dimensional \\u201ccubes\\u201d and so on. In addition to giving you some other interesting results, it will also be incredibly instructive for learning to think abstractly and apply inductive processes. The second moral is more like an admission: we have not technically proven the formula above for the sum of the first \\\\( n \\\\) square natural numbers. It seems like our derivation is valid and tells us the \\u201ccorrect answer\\u201d but there is a glaring issue: ellipses! In expanding the equation for \\\\((n + 1)^3\\\\) and obtaining those columns of terms that we collected into particular sums, writing \\\\(\\\\ldots\\\\) in the middle of those columns was helpful in guiding our intuition, but this is not a mathematically rigorous technique. How do we know that all of the terms in the middle are exactly what we\\u2019d expect them to be? How can we be so sure that all of our pictures of cubes translate perfectly into the mathematical expressions we wrote down? What do we really mean by \\u201cand keep going all the way down to 1\\u201d?\\n\\nAs an example, consider this:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n1, 2, 3, 4, \\\\ldots, 100\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWhat is that list of numbers? You probably interpreted it as \\u201call the natural numbers between 1 and 100, inclusive\\u201d. That seems reasonable. But what if we actually meant this list?\\n\\n\\\\[\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, \\\\ldots, 100\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWhy, of course, we meant the list of natural numbers from 1 to 100 that don\\u2019t have an \\u201ci\\u201d in their English spelling! Wasn\\u2019t it obvious?\\nThe point is this: when talking with a friend, and verbalizing some ideas, it might be okay to write \\u201c1, 2, 3, . . . , 100\\u201d and ensure that whoever is listening knows exactly what you mean. In general, though, we can\\u2019t assume that a reader would just naturally intuit whatever we were trying to convey; we should be as explicit and rigorous as possible.\\n\\nIt may seem to you now like we\\u2019re nit-picking, but the larger point is that there is a mathematical way of making this argument more precise, so that it constitutes a completely valid proof. Everything we have done so far is far useful in guiding our intuition, but we will have to do a little more work to be sure our arguments are completely convincing. There are a few other concepts required to make this type of argument rigorous, in general, and we will investigate those in the next chapter and return to this subject immediately after that. However, in the meantime, let\\u2019s examine one more example to practice this intuitive argument style and recognizing when induction is an applicable technique.\\n\\n2.2.2 Lines On The Plane\\n\\nTake a clean sheet of paper and a pen and a ruler. How many regions are on your sheet? Just one, right? Draw a line all the way across the paper. Now there are two regions. Draw another straight line that intersects your first line. How many regions are there? You should count four in total. Draw a third line that intersects both of the first two, but not at the point where the first two intersect. (That is, there should be three intersection points, in total.) How many regions are there? Can you predict the answer before counting? What happens when there are 4 lines? Or 5? Or 100? How do we approach this puzzle and, ultimately, solve it? Let\\u2019s give a more formal statement to be sure we\\u2019re thinking the same way:\\n\\nConsider $n$ lines on an infinite plane (two-dimensional surface) such that no two lines are parallel and no more than two lines intersect at one point. How many distinct regions do the lines create?\\n\\nWe can draw a few examples by hand when $n$ is small (up to, say, $n = 5$ is reasonable), and let\\u2019s use this to guide our intuition into making a general argument for an arbitrary value of $n$. (Notice that this strategy is very similar to what we did in the previous puzzle: identify a pattern with small cases, identify the relevant components of those cases that can generalize, then abstract to an arbitrary case.) Specifically, we want to attempt to identify how the number of regions in one drawing depends on the number of regions in a drawing with fewer lines. What happens when we draw a new line? Can we determine how this changes the already existing regions? Can we somehow count how many regions this creates? Do some investigation of this puzzle on your own before reading on. If you figure out some results, compare your work to the steps we follow below.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s start with a small case, say $n = 2$. We know one line divides a plane into 2 regions; what happens when we add a second line? We know we get 4 regions, because we can just look and count them:\\nHowever, we are only looking at one specific case of two intersecting lines. How do we know that we will always find four regions, no matter how we draw those two lines appropriately? That is, can we describe how this happens in a way that somehow incorporates the fact that the number of lines is $n = 2$? Think about it!\\n\\nHere\\u2019s our approach. Notice that each of the already existing regions is split into two when we add a second line, and that this is true no matter how you choose to draw the lines; as long as we make sure the two lines aren\\u2019t parallel, they will always behave this way. That is, if we take one line that splits the plane into two regions,\\n\\nthen adding a new line will split each of those existing regions in two. This adds two new regions to the whole plane, giving four regions in total:\\n\\nWhat about when $n = 3$? In this case, we want to think about adding a third line to a diagram with two lines and four regions. We want to make an argument that doesn\\u2019t depend on a particular arrangement of the lines, so eventually the only facts we should use are that no lines are parallel and any point of intersection only lies on two lines (not three or more). For now, though,\\nit helps to look at a particular arrangement of lines so that we are talking about the same diagram; we can use our observations of this specific diagram to guide our general argument. Let\\u2019s start with a two-line diagram, on the left below, and add a third line, but let\\u2019s choose the third line so that all of the intersection points are \\u201cnearby\\u201d or within the scope of the diagram, so that we don\\u2019t have to rescale the picture:\\n\\nWe certainly have 7 regions now, but we made the third line a separate color so that we can identify where the \\u201cnew\\u201d regions appear: one region (the lower quadrant, Region 4) remains unchanged, but the three other regions are split in two and each of those \\u201csplits\\u201d adds 1 to our count (where there was 1 region, now there are 2). What if we had placed the line differently?\\n\\nThe same phenomenon occurs, where one quadrant remains untouched but the other three are split in two. (How do we know there aren\\u2019t any other regions not depicted within the scale of our diagram? This is not as easy a question to answer as you might think at first blush, and it\\u2019s worth thinking about.) Experiment with other arrangements of the three lines and try to convince yourself that this always happens; also, think about why this is the case and how we could explain that this must happen. Before giving a general explanation, though, let\\u2019s examine another small case.\\n\\nWhen \\\\( n = 4 \\\\), we start with three lines and 7 regions and add a fourth line that is not parallel to any of the existing lines and doesn\\u2019t pass through any existing intersection points. Again, we will want to make an argument that isn\\u2019t tied to a specific arrangement of the lines, but looking at the following specific diagram will help guide our intuition into making that argument:\\nNotice that three of the original regions remain unchanged (Regions 3 and 5 and 7), and the other four are split in two. Do you notice a pattern here? It seems like for every \\\\( n \\\\) we\\u2019ve examined, adding the \\\\( n \\\\)-th line leaves exactly \\\\( n - 1 \\\\) regions unchanged while the rest are split in two. Let\\u2019s try to explain why this happens. Remember that we\\u2019re trying to identify how many regions appear when we draw \\\\( n \\\\) lines, so let\\u2019s assign that value a \\u201cname\\u201d so we can refer to it; let\\u2019s say \\\\( R(n) \\\\) represents the number of regions created by drawing \\\\( n \\\\) lines on the plane so that no two lines are parallel and no intersection point belongs to more than two lines. In these examples we\\u2019ve considered for small values of \\\\( n \\\\), we\\u2019ve looked at what changes when we add a new line; that is, we\\u2019ve figured out what \\\\( R(n) \\\\) is by already knowing \\\\( R(n - 1) \\\\). Let\\u2019s try to adapt our observations so that they apply to any arbitrary value of \\\\( n \\\\).\\n\\nAssume that we know \\\\( R(n) \\\\) already. (Why can we do this? Do we know any particular value of \\\\( R(n) \\\\) for sure, for some specific \\\\( n \\\\)? Which? How?) Say we have an arbitrary diagram of \\\\( n \\\\) lines on the plane that satisfy the two conditions given in the puzzle statement above. How many regions do these lines create? Yes, exactly \\\\( R(n) \\\\). Now, what happens when we add the \\\\( (n + 1) \\\\)-th line? What can we say for sure about this line and how it alters the diagram? Well, the only information we really have is that (a) this new line is not parallel to any of the existing \\\\( n \\\\) lines and (b) this new line does not intersect any of the already existing intersection points. Now, condition (a) tells us that this new line must intersect all of the existing \\\\( n \\\\) lines; parallel lines don\\u2019t intersect, and non-parallel lines must intersect somewhere. Thus, we must create \\\\( n \\\\) new intersection points on the diagram. Can any of those intersection points coincide with any existing intersection points? No! This is precisely what condition (b) tells us. These two pieces of information together tell us that, no matter how we draw this new line, as long as it satisfies the requirements of the puzzle, we must be able to identify \\\\( n \\\\) \\u201cspecial\\u201d points along that line. Those special points are precisely the points where the new line intersects an existing line.\\n\\nWe\\u2019d now like to take these special points and use them to identify new regions in the diagram. Look back to the cases we examined above: identify the new intersection points and see if you can associate them with new regions. Perhaps it would help to label those intersections with a large dot and mark the new regions with an \\\\( X \\\\) to make them all stand out. We\\u2019ll show you one example below, where \\\\( n = 4 \\\\). What do you notice? Can you use these dots to\\nhelp identify how many new regions are created with the addition of that \\\\( n \\\\)-th line? Think about this for a minute and then read on.\\n\\nExactly! Between any two of the new intersection points, we have a line segment that splits a region in two! All that remains is to identify how many new such segments we\\u2019ve created. Since each one corresponds to exactly one existing region split in two, this will tell us exactly how many new regions we\\u2019ve created. We\\u2019ve already figured out that this \\\\((n + 1)\\\\)-th line creates \\\\( n \\\\) new intersection points. Think about how these points are arranged on the line. Any two \\u201cconsecutive\\u201d points create a segment, but the extreme points also create infinite segments (that continue past those extreme points forever). How many are there in total? Exactly \\\\( n + 1 \\\\). (Look at the diagram above, for \\\\( n = 3 \\\\). We see that there are 3 new intersection points and 4 new segments, with two of them being infinite rays.) This means there are \\\\( n + 1 \\\\) line segments that split regions in two, so we have created exactly \\\\( n + 1 \\\\) new regions! This allows us to say that\\n\\n\\\\[\\nR(n + 1) = R(n) + n + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nPhew, what an observation! It took a bit of playing around with examples and making some geometric arguments, but here we are. We\\u2019ve identified some inductive structure to this puzzle; we\\u2019ve found how one case depends on another one. That is, we\\u2019ve found how \\\\( R(n+1) \\\\) depends on \\\\( R(n) \\\\). This hasn\\u2019t completely solved the puzzle, but we are now much closer. All that remains is to replace \\\\( R(n) \\\\) with a similar expression, and continually do this until we reach a value we know, \\\\( R(1) = 2 \\\\). Observe:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nR(n + 1) = \\\\\\\\\\n= R(n - 2) + \\\\frac{R(n-1)}{(n-1)} + \\\\frac{R(n)}{n} + n + 1 \\\\\\\\\\n= R(1) + 2 + 3 + \\\\cdots + n + n + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince we know \\\\( R(1) = 2 \\\\), we can say\\n\\n\\\\[\\nR(n + 1) = 2 + (2 + 3 + \\\\cdots + n + (n + 1)) = 2 + \\\\left( \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k \\\\right) - 1 = 1 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k\\n\\\\]\\nand this is a sum we have investigated before! (Also notice that we had to subtract 1 because of the missing first term of the sum in parentheses.) Recall that $\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, and to represent the sum we have in the equation above, we just replace $n$ with $n + 1$. Therefore,\\n\\n$$R(n + 1) = 1 + \\\\frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}$$\\n\\nOne final simplification we would like to make is to replace $n+1$ with $n$ throughout the equation, because it makes more sense to have an expression for $R(n)$ (For what values of $n$ is this valid?)\\n\\n$$R(n) = 1 + \\\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$$\\n\\nFinally, we have arrived at an answer to the originally-posed puzzle! In so doing, we employed an inductive technique: we explained how one \\u201cfact\\u201d, namely the value of $R(n + 1)$, depends on the value of a \\u201cprevious fact\\u201d, namely $R(n)$, and used these iterative dependencies to work backwards until we reached a particular, known value, namely $R(1)$.\\n\\nWe want to point out, again, that the derivation we followed and the observations we made in this section have guided our intuition into an answer, but this has not rigorously proven anything. The issue is with the \\u201c\\u00b7\\u00b7\\u00b7\\u201d, which is not a concrete, \\u201cofficially\\u201d mathematical way of capturing the inductive process underlying our technique. Furthermore, our method with the \\u201clines in the plane\\u201d problem had us starting with a diagram of $n - 1$ lines and building a new diagram with $n$ lines; is this okay? Why does this actually tell us anything about an arbitrary diagram of $n$ lines? Do all such diagrams come from a smaller diagram with one fewer line?\\n\\nWe will, in the next two chapters, learn the necessary tools to fully describe a rigorous way of doing what we have done so far, and in the chapter after that, we will employ those tools to make mathematical induction officially rigorous. For now, though, we want to give a heuristic definition of induction and continue to examine interesting puzzles and observations that rely on inductive techniques. Practicing with these types of puzzles\\u2014learning when to recognize an inductive process, how to work with it, how to use that structure to solve a problem, and so on\\u2014will be extremely helpful in the future, and we have no need to delve into technical mathematical detail. (At least, not just yet!)\\n\\n2.2.3 Questions & Exercises\\n\\nRemind Yourself\\n\\nAnswering the following questions briefly, either out loud or in writing. These are all based on the section you just read, so if you can\\u2019t recall a specific definition or concept or example, go back and reread that part. Making sure you can confidently answer these before moving on will help your understanding and memory!\\n(1) What properties characterize an inductive process?\\n\\n(2) How did we prove that \\\\( \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\) is correct? How was our method inductive? (Reread Section 1.4.2 if you forget!)\\n\\n(3) Why can we take the sum formula mentioned in the previous question and \\u201creplace\\u201d \\\\( n \\\\) with \\\\( n+1 \\\\) and know that it still holds true? Can we also replace \\\\( n \\\\) with \\\\( n-1 \\\\)?\\n\\n(4) Work through the algebraic steps to obtain our final expression for the sum of the first \\\\( n \\\\) squares; that is, verify that\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{1}{3}(n+1)^3 - \\\\frac{1}{3}(n+1) - \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n(5) Try to recall the argument that adding the \\\\((n+1)\\\\)-th line on the plane created exactly \\\\( n+1 \\\\) new regions. Can you work through the argument for a friend and convince him/her that it is valid?\\n\\n(6) To find the sum of the first \\\\( n \\\\) squares, why couldn\\u2019t we just square the formula for the sum of the first \\\\( n \\\\) numbers? Why is that wrong?\\n\\nTry It\\n\\nTry answering the following short-answer questions. They require you to actually write something down, or describe something out loud (to a friend/classmate, perhaps). The goal is to get you to practice working with new concepts, definitions, and notation. They are meant to be easy, though; making sure you can work through them will help you!\\n\\n(1) Draw 5 lines on the plane (that satisfy the two conditions of the puzzle) and verify that there are 16 regions. Can you also verify that 6 lines yield 22 regions?\\n\\n(2) Come up with another description of a sequence that goes 1, 2, 3, 4, \\\\ldots, 100 that is not simply all of the numbers from 1 to 100. (Recall the example we gave: all the numbers from 1 to 100 with no \\u201ci\\u201d in their English spelling.)\\n\\n(3) Come up with an algebraic expression that relates \\\\((n+1)^4\\\\) to \\\\(n^4\\\\), like we did with cubes.\\n\\n(Challenge: Can you come up with a geometric interpretation for the expression you just derived?)\\n\\n(4) Challenge: Let\\u2019s bump the \\u201clines in the plane\\u201d puzzle up one dimension! Think about having \\\\( n \\\\) planes in three-dimensional space. How many regions are created? Assume that no two planes are parallel, and no three of them intersect in one line. (Think about how these two conditions are directly analogous to the specified conditions for the \\u201clines\\u201d puzzle.)\\n2.3 Defining Induction\\n\\nTo properly motivate the forthcoming definition of mathematical induction as a proof technique, we want to emphasize that the above examples used some intuitive notions of the structure of the puzzle to develop a \\u201csolution\\u201d, where we use quotation marks around solution to indicate that we haven\\u2019t officially proven it yet. In that sense, we ask the following question: What if we had been given the formula that we derived and asked to verify it? What if we had not gone through any intuitive steps to derive the formula and someone just told us that it is correct? How could we check their claim? The reason we ask this is because we are really facing that situation now, except the person telling us the formula is . . . the very same intuitive argument we discovered above!\\n\\nPretend you have a skeptical friend who says, \\u201cHey, I heard about this formula for the sum of the first \\\\( n \\\\) natural numbers squared. Somebody told me that they add up to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{6} n(n+1)(2n+1) \\\\). I checked the first two natural numbers, and it worked, so it\\u2019s gotta be right. Pass it on!\\u201d Being a logical thinker, but also a good friend, you nod along and say, \\u201cI did hear that, but let\\u2019s make sure it\\u2019s correct for every number.\\u201d How would you proceed? Your friend is right that the first few values \\u201cwork out\\u201d nicely:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n1^2 &= 1 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(1)(2)(3) \\\\\\\\\\n1^2 + 2^2 &= 5 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(2)(3)(5) \\\\\\\\\\n1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 &= 14 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(3)(4)(7) \\\\\\\\\\n1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 &= 30 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(4)(5)(9)\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand so on. We could even check, by hand, a large value of \\\\( n \\\\), if we wanted to:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 = 385 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(10)(11)(21)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nRemember, though, that this formula is claimed to be valid for any value of \\\\( n \\\\). Checking individual results by hand would take forever, because there are an infinite number of natural numbers. No matter how many individual values of \\\\( n \\\\) we check, there will always be larger values, and how do we know that the formula doesn\\u2019t break down for some large value? We need a far more efficient procedure, mathematically and temporally speaking, to somehow verify the formula for all values of \\\\( n \\\\) in just a few steps. We have an idea in mind, of course (it\\u2019s the upcoming rigorous version of mathematical induction), and here we will explain how the procedure works, in a broad sense.\\n\\n2.3.1 The Domino Analogy\\n\\nPretend that we have a set of dominoes. This is a special set of dominoes because we have an infinite number of them (!) and we can imagine anything we want\\nwritten on them, instead of the standard array of dots. Let\\u2019s also pretend that they are set up in an infinite line along an infinite tabletop, and we are viewing the dominos from the side and we can see a label under each one so that we know where we are in the line:\\n\\n\\\\[n = 1\\\\quad n = 2\\\\quad n = 3\\\\quad n = 4\\\\quad n = 5\\\\]\\n\\nFor this particular example, to verify the formula\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6}n(n + 1)(2n + 1)\\\\]\\n\\nwe will imagine a particular \\u201cfact\\u201d written on each domino. Specifically, we will imagine that the 1st domino has the expression\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\sum_{k=1}^{1} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(1)(2)(3)\\\\]\\n\\nwritten on it, and the 2nd domino has the expression\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\sum_{k=1}^{2} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(2)(3)(5)\\\\]\\n\\nwritten on it. In general, we imagine that the \\\\(n\\\\)-th domino in the infinite line has the following \\u201cfact\\u201d written on it:\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6}n(n + 1)(2n + 1)\\\\]\\n\\nSince we\\u2019re dealing with dominos that are meant to fall into each other and knock each other over, let\\u2019s pretend that whenever a domino falls, that means the corresponding \\u201cfact\\u201d written on it is a true statement. This is how we will relate our physical interpretation of the dominos to the mathematical interpretation of the validity of the formula we derived.\\n\\nWe did check the sum for \\\\(n = 1\\\\) by hand: \\\\(1^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(1)(2)(3)\\\\). Thus, the fact written on the first domino is a true statement, so we know that the first domino will, indeed, fall over. We also checked the sum for \\\\(n = 2\\\\) by hand, so we know that the second domino will fall over:\\nHowever, continuing like this brings us back to the same problem as before: we don\\u2019t want to check every individual domino to make sure it falls. We would really like to encapsulate our physical notion of the line of dominos\\u2014namely, that when a domino falls it will topple into the next one and knock that over, and so on\\u2014and somehow relate the \\u201cfacts\\u201d that are written on adjacent dominos.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s look at this situation for the first two dominos. Knowing that Domino 1 falls, can we guarantee that Domino 2 falls without rewriting all of the terms of the sum? How are the statements written on the two dominos related? Each statement is a sum of squared natural numbers, and the one on the second domino has exactly one more term. Thus, knowing already that Domino 1 has fallen, we can use the true statement written on Domino 1 to verify the truth of the statement written on Domino 2:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{2} k^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(2)(3)(5)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nNow, this may seem a little silly because the only \\u201cwork\\u201d we have saved is not having to \\u201cdo the arithmetic\\u201d to write \\\\(1^2 = 1\\\\). Let\\u2019s use this procedure on a case with larger numbers so we can more convincingly illustrate the benefit of this method. Let\\u2019s assume that Domino 10 has fallen. (In case you are worried about this assumption, we wrote the full sum a few paragraphs ago and you can verify it there.) This means we know that\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{10} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(10)(11)(21) = 385\\n\\\\]\\n\\nis a true statement. Let\\u2019s use this to verify the statement written on Domino 11, which is\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{11} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(11)(12)(23)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe sum written on Domino 11 has 11 terms, and the first 10 are exactly the sum written on Domino 10! Since we know something about that sum, let\\u2019s just separate that 11th term from the sum and apply our knowledge of the other\\nterms:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{11} k^2 = (1^2 + 2^2 + \\\\cdots + 10^2) + 11^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n= \\\\left( \\\\sum_{k=1}^{10} k^2 \\\\right) + 11^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n= 385 + 121\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n= 506\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n= \\\\frac{1}{6} \\\\cdot 3036 = \\\\frac{1}{6}(11)(12)(23)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nLook at all of the effort we saved! Why bother reading the first 10 terms of the sum if we know something about them already?\\n\\nNow, imagine if we could do this procedure for all values of \\\\( n \\\\), simultaneously! That is, imagine that we could prove that any time Domino \\\\( n \\\\) falls, we are guaranteed that Domino \\\\( (n + 1) \\\\) falls. What would this tell us? Well, think about the infinite line of dominos again. We know Domino 1 will fall, because we checked that value by hand. Then, because we verified the \\u201cDomino \\\\( n \\\\) knocks over Domino \\\\( (n + 1) \\\\)\\u201d step for all values of \\\\( n \\\\), we know Domino 1 will fall into Domino 2, which in turn falls into Domino 3, which in turns falls into Domino 4, which \\u2026 The entire line of dominos will fall! In essence, we could collapse the whole line of dominos falling down into just two steps:\\n\\n(a) Make sure the first domino topples;\\n\\n(b) Make sure every domino knocks over the one immediately after it in line.\\n\\nWith only these two steps, we can guarantee every domino falls and, therefore, prove that all of the facts written on them are true. This will prove that the formula we derived is valid for every natural number \\\\( n \\\\).\\n\\nWe have already accomplished step (a), so now we have to complete step (b). We have done this for specific cases in the previous paragraphs (Domino 1 topples Domino 2, and Domino 10 topples Domino 11), so let\\u2019s try to follow along with the steps of those cases and generalize to an arbitrary value of \\\\( n \\\\). We assume, for some specific but arbitrary value of \\\\( n \\\\), that Domino \\\\( n \\\\) falls, which tells us that the equation\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6} n(n + 1)(2n + 1)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nis a true statement. Now, we want to relate this to the statement written on Domino \\\\( (n + 1) \\\\) and apply the knowledge given in the equation above. Let\\u2019s do what we did before and write a sum of \\\\( n + 1 \\\\) terms as a sum of \\\\( n \\\\) terms plus the last term:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + \\\\cdots + n^2 + (n + 1)^2 = \\\\left( \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \\\\right) + (n + 1)^2\\n\\\\]\\nNext, we can apply our assumption that Domino \\\\( n \\\\) has fallen (which tells us that the fact written on it is true) and write\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6} n(n + 1)(2n + 1) + (n + 1)^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nIs this the same as the fact written on Domino \\\\((n + 1)\\\\)? Let\\u2019s look at what that is, first, and then compare. The \\u201cfact\\u201d on Domino \\\\((n + 1)\\\\) is similar to the fact on Domino \\\\( n \\\\), except everywhere we see \\u201c\\\\( n \\\\)\\u201d we replace it with \\u201c\\\\( n + 1 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6} (n + 1)((n + 1) + 1)(2(n + 1) + 1) = \\\\frac{1}{6} (n + 1)(n + 2)(2n + 3)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nIt is not clear yet whether the expression we have derived thus far is actually equal to this. We could attempt to simplify the expression we\\u2019ve derived and factor it to make it \\u201clook like\\u201d this new expression, but it might be easier to just expand both expressions and compare all the terms. (This is motivated by the general idea that expanding a factored polynomial is far easier than recognizing a polynomial can be factored.) For the first expression, we get\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{1}{6} n(n + 1)(2n + 1) + (n + 1)^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6} n(2n^2 + 3n + 1) + (n^2 + 2n + 1)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n= \\\\frac{1}{3} n^3 + \\\\frac{1}{2} n^2 + \\\\frac{1}{6} n + n^2 + 2n + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n= \\\\frac{1}{3} n^3 + \\\\frac{3}{2} n^2 + \\\\frac{13}{6} n + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand for the second expression, we get\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{1}{6} (n + 1)(n + 2)(2n + 3) = \\\\frac{1}{6} (n + 1)(2n^2 + 7n + 6)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n= \\\\frac{1}{6} \\\\left[(2n^3 + 7n^2 + 6n) + (2n^2 + 7n + 6)\\\\right]\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n= \\\\frac{1}{3} n^3 + \\\\frac{3}{2} n^2 + \\\\frac{13}{6} n + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nLook at that; they\\u2019re identical! Also, notice how much easier this was than trying to rearrange one of the expressions and \\u201cmorph\\u201d it into the other. We proved they were identical by manipulating them both and finding the same expression, ultimately. Now, let\\u2019s look back and assess what we have accomplished:\\n\\n1. We likened proving the validity of the formula\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\\\frac{1}{6} n(n + 1)(2n + 1)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nfor all values of \\\\( n \\\\) to knocking over an infinite line of dominos.\\n2. We verified that Domino 1 will fall by checking the formula corresponding to that case by hand.\\n\\n3. We proved that Domino \\\\( n \\\\) will fall into Domino \\\\((n+1)\\\\) and knock it over by assuming the fact written on Domino \\\\( n \\\\) is true and using that knowledge to show that the fact written on Domino \\\\((n+1)\\\\) must also be true.\\n\\n4. This guarantees that all dominoes will fall, so the formula is true for all values of \\\\( n \\\\).\\n\\nAre you convinced by this technique? Do you think we\\u2019ve rigorously proven that the formula is valid for all natural numbers \\\\( n \\\\)? What if there were a value of \\\\( n \\\\) for which the formula didn\\u2019t hold? What would that mean in terms of our domino scheme?\\n\\nRemember that this domino analogy is a good intuitive guide for how induction works, but it is not built on mathematically rigorous foundations. That will be the goal of the next couple of chapters. For now, let\\u2019s revisit the other example we\\u2019ve examined in this section: lines in the plane. Again, the use of ellipses in our derivation of the formula \\\\( R(n) \\\\) is troublesome and we want to avoid it. Let\\u2019s try to follow along with the domino scheme in the context of this puzzle.\\n\\nImagine that we have defined the expression \\\\( R(n) \\\\) to represent the number of distinct regions in the plane created by \\\\( n \\\\) lines, where no two lines are parallel and no three intersect at one point. Also, imagine that on Domino \\\\( n \\\\) we have written the \\u201cfact\\u201d that \\\\( R(n) = 1 + \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\). Can we follow the same steps as above and verify that all the dominoes will fall?\\n\\nFirst, we need to check that Domino 1 does, indeed fall. This amounts to verifying the statement: \\u201c\\\\( R(1) = 1 + \\\\frac{1(2)}{2} = 1+1 = 2 \\\\)\\u201d. Is this a true statement? Yes, of course, we saw this before; one line divides the plane into two regions. Second, we need to prove that Domino \\\\( n \\\\) will topple into Domino \\\\((n+1)\\\\) for any arbitrary value of \\\\( n \\\\). That is, let\\u2019s assume that \\\\( R(n) = 1 + \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\) is a true statement for some value of \\\\( n \\\\) and show that \\\\( R(n+1) = 1 + \\\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\\\) must also be a true statement. How can we do this? Well, let\\u2019s follow along with the argument we used before to relate \\\\( R(n+1) \\\\) to \\\\( R(n) \\\\). By considering the geometric consequences of adding an extra line to any diagram with \\\\( n \\\\) lines (that also fit our rules about the lines) we proved that \\\\( R(n+1) = R(n) + n + 1 \\\\). Using this knowledge and our assumption about Domino \\\\( n \\\\) falling, we can say that\\n\\n\\\\[\\nR(n+1) = R(n) + n + 1 = 1 + \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\nIs this the same expression as what is written on Domino \\\\((n+1)\\\\)? Again, let\\u2019s simplify both expressions to verify they are the same. We have\\n\\n\\\\[\\n1 + \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n + 1 = 2 + n + \\\\frac{n^2 + n}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\\\frac{3}{2}n + 2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\\\[\\n1 + \\\\frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} = 1 + \\\\frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\\\frac{3}{2}n + 2\\n\\\\]\\n2.3. DEFINING INDUCTION\\n\\nLook at that; they\\u2019re identical! Thus, we have shown that Domino $n$ is guaranteed to fall into Domino $(n+1)$, for any value of $n$. Accordingly, we can declare that all dominoes will fall!\\n\\nThink about the differences between what we have done with this \\u201cdomino technique\\u201d and what we did before to derive the expressions we just proved. Did we use any ellipses in this section? Why is it better to prove a formula this way? Could we have used the domino induction technique to derive the formulas themselves?\\n\\n2.3.2 Other Analogies\\n\\nThe Domino Analogy is quite popular, but it\\u2019s not the only description of how induction works. Depending on what you read, or who you talk to, you might learn of a different analogy, or some other kind of description altogether. Here, we\\u2019ll describe a couple that we\\u2019ve heard of before. It will help solidify your understanding of induction (at least as far as we\\u2019ve developed it) to think about how these analogies are all equivalent, fundamentally.\\n\\n**Mojo the Magical, Mathematical Monkey**\\n\\nImagine an infinite ladder, heading straight upwards into the sky. There are infinitely-many rungs on this ladder, numbered in order: 1, 2, 3, and so on going upwards. Our friend Mojo happens to be standing next to this ladder. He is an intelligent monkey, very interested in mathematics but also a little bit magical, because he can actually climb up this infinite ladder!\\n\\nIf Mojo makes it to a certain rung on the ladder, that means the fact corresponding to that number is True. How can we make sure he climbs up the entire ladder? It would be inefficient to check each rung individually. Imagine that: we would have to stand on the ground and make sure he got to Rung 1, then we would have to look up a bit and make sure he got to Rung 2, and then Rung 3, and so on . . . Instead, let\\u2019s just confirm two details with Mojo before he starts climbing. Is he going to start climbing? That is, is he going to make it to Rung 1? If so, great! Also, are the rungs close enough together so that he can always reach the next one, no matter where he is? If so, even greater! These are exactly like the conditions established in our Domino Analogy. To ensure that Mojo gets to every rung, we just need to know he gets to the first one and that he can always get to the next one.\\n\\n**Doug the Induction Duck**\\n\\nMeet Doug. He\\u2019s a duck. He also loves bread, and he\\u2019s going to go searching through everyone\\u2019s yards to find more bread. These yards are all along Induction Street in Math Town, where the houses are numbered 1, 2, 3, and so on, all in a row.\\n\\nDoug starts in the yard of house #1, looking for bread. He doesn\\u2019t find any, so he\\u2019s still hungry. Where else can he look? The house next door, #2, has a\\nbackyard, too! Doug heads that way, his tummy rumbling. He doesn\\u2019t find any bread there, either, so he has to keep looking. He already knows house #1 has no bread, so the only place to go is next door to house #3. We think you see where this is going . . .\\n\\nIf we were keeping track of Doug\\u2019s progress, we might wonder whether he eventually gets to every yard. Let\\u2019s say we also knew ahead of time that nobody has any bread. This means that whenever he\\u2019s in someone\\u2019s yard, he will definitely go to the next house, still searching for a meal. This means that he will definitely get to every house! That is, no matter which house we live in, no matter how large the number on our front door might be, at some point we will see Doug wandering around our backyard. (Unfortunately, he will go hungry all this time, though! Poor Doug.)\\n\\n2.3.3 Summary\\n\\nLet\\u2019s reconsider what we\\u2019ve accomplished with the two example puzzles we\\u2019ve seen thus far, and the analogies we\\u2019ve given. In our initial consideration of each puzzle, we identified some aspect of the structure of the puzzle where a \\u201cfact\\u201d depended on a \\u201cprevious fact\\u201d. In the case of the cubic numbers, we found a way to express \\\\((n + 1)^3\\\\) in terms of \\\\(n^3\\\\); in the case of the lines in the plane, we described how many regions were added when an extra line was added to a diagram with \\\\(n\\\\) lines. From these observations, we applied this encapsulated knowledge over and over until we arrived at a \\u201cfact\\u201d that we knew, for a \\u201csmall\\u201d value of \\\\(n\\\\). This allowed us to derive a formula or equation or expression for a general fact that should hold for any value of \\\\(n\\\\).\\n\\nThis work was interesting and essential for deriving these expressions, but it was not enough to prove the validity of the expressions. In doing the work described above, we identified the presence of an inductive process and utilized its structure to derive the expressions in question. This was beneficial in two ways, really; we actually found the expressions we wanted to prove and, by recognizing the inductive behavior of the puzzle, we realized that proving the expressions by mathematical induction would be prudent and efficient.\\n\\nFor the actual \\u201cproof by induction\\u201d, we followed two main steps. First, we identified a \\u201cstarting value\\u201d for which we could check the formula/equation by hand. Second, we assumed that one particular value of \\\\(n\\\\) made the corresponding formula hold true, and then used this knowledge to show that the corresponding formula for the value \\\\(n + 1\\\\) must also hold true. Between those two steps, we could rest assured that \\u201call dominos will fall\\u201d and, therefore, the formulas would hold true for all relevant values of \\\\(n\\\\).\\n\\nOne Concern: What\\u2019s at the \\u201ctop\\u201d of the ladder?\\n\\nYou might be worried about something, and we\\u2019ll try to anticipate your question here. (We only bring this up because it\\u2019s a not uncommon observation to make. If you weren\\u2019t thinking about this, try to imagine where the idea would come from.) You might say, \\u201cHey now, I think I see how Mojo is climbing the ladder,\\n2.3. DEFINING INDUCTION\\n\\nbut how can he actually get all the way to the top? It\\u2019s an infinite ladder, right? And he never gets there . . . right?\\\"\\n\\nIn a way, you would be right. Since this magical ladder really does go on forever, then there is truly no end to it and Mojo will never get \\u201cthere\\u201d. However, that isn\\u2019t the point; we don\\u2019t care about any \\u201cend\\u201d of the ladder (and not just because there isn\\u2019t one). We just need to know that Mojo actually gets to every possible rung. He doesn\\u2019t have to surpass all of them and stand at the top of the ladder, looking down at where he came from. That wasn\\u2019t the goal!\\n\\nThink of it this way: pretend you have a vested interest in some particular fact that we\\u2019re proving. Let\\u2019s say it\\u2019s Fact #18,458,789,572,311,000,574,003. (Some huge number. It doesn\\u2019t matter, really.) Its corresponding rung is waaayyyyy up there on the ladder, and all you care about is whether or not Mojo gets there on his journey. Does he? . . . You bet he does! It might take a long time (how many steps will it take?), but in this magical world of monkeys and ladders, who cares about time anyway! You know that he\\u2019ll eventually get there, and that makes you happy. Now, just imagine that for each fact, there\\u2019s somebody out there in that magical world that cares about only that fact. Surely, everyone will be happy with the knowledge that Mojo will get to their rung on his journey. Nobody cares about whether he gets to the top; that isn\\u2019t their concern. Meanwhile, out here in our regular, non-magical world, we are extremely happy with the fact that everyone in that world will eventually be happy. That entire infinite process of ladder-climbing was condensed into just two steps, and with only those two steps, we can rest assured that every rung on that ladder will be touched. Every numbered fact is true.\\n\\nThink about this in terms of the Domino Analogy, as well. Do we care whether or not there is some \\u201cending point\\u201d of the line of dominoes, so that they all fall into a wall somewhere? Of course not; the line goes on forever. Every domino will eventually fall over, and we don\\u2019t even care how \\u201clong\\u201d that takes. Likewise, we know Doug will get to everyone\\u2019s yard; we don\\u2019t care \\u201cwhen\\u201d he gets to any individual yard, just that he gets to all of them.\\n\\n2.3.4 Questions & Exercises\\n\\nRemind Yourself\\n\\nAnswering the following questions briefly, either out loud or in writing. These are all based on the section you just read, so if you can\\u2019t recall a specific definition or concept or example, go back and reread that part. Making sure you can confidently answer these before moving on will help your understanding and memory!\\n\\n(1) How are the Domino, Mojo, and Doug analogies all equivalent?

Does this mean that there are some dominoes that will never fall down? Try to describe what this means in terms of the analogy.\\n\\nTry It\\n\\nTry answering the following short-answer questions. They require you to actually write something down, or describe something out loud (to a friend/classmate, perhaps). The goal is to get you to practice working with new concepts, definitions, and notation. They are meant to be easy, though; making sure you can work through them will help you!\\n\\n(1) Work through the inductive steps to prove the formula\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\]\\n\\n(2) Work through the inductive steps to prove the formula\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) = n^2 \\\\]\\n\\n(3) Work through the inductive steps to prove the formula\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 = \\\\left( \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\right)^2 \\\\]\\n\\n(4) Suppose we have a series of facts that are indexed by natural numbers.

Can we do this? Can you come up with a modification of one of the analogies we gave that would describe your method?\\n2.4 Two More (Different) Examples\\n\\nThis short section serves a few purposes. For one, we don\\u2019t want you to get the idea, right away, that induction is all about proving a numerical formula with numbers and polynomials. Induction is so much more useful than that! One of the following examples, in particular, will be about proving some abstract property is true for any \\u201csize\\u201d of the given situation. You will see how it still falls under the umbrella of \\u201cinduction\\u201d, but you will also notice how it is different from the previous examples. Furthermore, these examples will illustrate that sometimes we need to know \\u201cmore information\\u201d to knock over some dominoes. In the previous examples, we only needed to know that Domino $n$ fell to guarantee that Domino $n + 1$ will fall. Here, though, we might have to know about several previous dominoes. After these two examples, we will summarize how this differs from the domino definition given above, and preview a broader definition of the technique of induction, as it applies to these examples.\\n\\n2.4.1 Dominos and Tilings\\n\\nThis next example is a little more complicated than the first two. We will still end up proving a certain numerical formula, but the problem is decidedly more visual than just manipulating algebraic expressions. Furthermore, we\\u2019ll notice an interesting \\u201ckink\\u201d in the starting steps, where we have to solve a couple of \\u201csmall cases\\u201d before being able to generalize our approach. This will be our first consideration of how the technique of induction can be generalized and adapted to other situations.\\n\\nThe question we want to answer is nicely stated as follows:\\n\\nGiven a $2 \\\\times n$ array of squares, how many different ways can we tile the array with dominoes? A tiling must have every square covered by one\\u2013and only one\\u2013domino.\\n\\nFor example, the following are proper tilings\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{ccc}\\n\\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array} & \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array} & \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhereas the following are not proper tilings\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{ccc}\\n\\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array} & \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array} & \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAs before, let\\u2019s examine the first few cases\\u2014where \\\\( n = 1, 2, 3, \\\\) and so on\\u2014and see if we notice any patterns. Try working with the problem yourself, before reading on, even!\\n\\nWhen \\\\( n = 1 \\\\), we have an array that is exactly the shape of one domino, so surely there is only one way to do this. Let\\u2019s use the notation \\\\( T(n) \\\\) to represent the number of tilings on a \\\\( 2 \\\\times n \\\\) array. Thus, \\\\( T(1) = 1 \\\\).\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{c}\\n\\\\text{1st case:}\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWhen \\\\( n = 2 \\\\), we have a \\\\( 2 \\\\times 2 \\\\) array. Since the orientation of the array matters, we have each of the following distinct tilings. Thus, \\\\( T(2) = 2 \\\\).\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{c}\\n\\\\text{2nd case:}\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWhat about when \\\\( n = 3 \\\\)? Again, we can enumerate these tilings by hand and be sure that we aren\\u2019t missing any. We see that \\\\( T(3) = 3 \\\\).\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{c}\\n\\\\text{3rd case:}\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nOkay, one more case, when \\\\( n = 4 \\\\). We see that \\\\( T(4) = 5 \\\\).\\nCan we start to find a pattern now? Writing out larger arrays will just be tiresome! Let\\u2019s think about how we could have used the fact that $T(1) = 1$ to deduce something about $T(2)$ ... Well, wait a minute ... We couldn\\u2019t, right? There was something fundamentally different about those two cases. Specifically, because dominoes are $2 \\\\times 1$ in size, the fact that we only added one row to the array didn\\u2019t help us.\\n\\nAlright, let\\u2019s consider $n = 3$, then. Could we use the fact that $T(2) = 2$ at all? In this case, yes! Knowing there were two tilings of the $2 \\\\times 2$ array, we could immediately build two tilings of the $2 \\\\times 3$ array without much thought. Specifically, we can just append a vertical domino to each of those previous tilings. But we know now that $T(3) = 3$. Where did the third tiling come from? Look at that tiling again and how it compares to the other two. In that third tiling, the dominoes on the right side are horizontal, as opposed to the vertical one in the other two tilings. If we remove those two parallel, horizontal dominoes, we are left with precisely the situation when $n = 1$. Put another way, we can build a tiling of a $2 \\\\times 3$ array by appending a square of two horizontal dominoes to the right side. In total, then, we have described all of the tilings of a $2 \\\\times 3$ board in terms of boards of smaller sizes, namely $2 \\\\times 2$ and $2 \\\\times 1$:\\n\\nNow you might see how the pattern develops! Let\\u2019s show you what happens when $n = 4$, how we can construct all of the tilings that make up $T(4)$ by appending a vertical domino to each of the tilings that make up $T(3)$, or by appending two horizontal dominoes to each of the tilings that make up $T(2)$:\\nNotice, as well, that no tiling for the 2 \\u00d7 4 array was produced twice in this way. (Think carefully about why this is true. How can we characterize the two types of tilings in a way that will guarantee they don\\u2019t coincide at all?) With this information, we can immediately conclude that \\\\( T(4) = T(3) + T(2) \\\\).\\n\\nFurthermore, we can generalize this argument; nothing was special about \\\\( n = 4 \\\\), right? For any particular \\\\( n \\\\), we can just consider all possible tilings, and look at what happens on the far right-hand side of the array: either we have one vertical domino (which means the tiling came from a 2 \\u00d7 (\\\\( n - 1 \\\\)) array) or two horizontal dominoes (which means the tiling came from a 2 \\u00d7 (\\\\( n - 2 \\\\)) array). With confidence in this argument, we can conclude that\\n\\n\\\\[\\nT(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nfor all of the values of \\\\( n \\\\) for which this expression makes sense. What values are those? Remember that we had to identify \\\\( T(1) \\\\) and \\\\( T(2) \\\\) separately; this argument doesn\\u2019t apply to those values. Accordingly, we have to add the restriction \\\\( n \\\\geq 3 \\\\) for the equation above to hold true.\\n\\nWith this information, we can then easily figure out \\\\( T(n) \\\\) for any value of \\\\( n \\\\), given enough time. We could write a computer program fairly easily, even. It was this inductive argument, though\\u2014the pattern that we noticed and our thorough description of why it occurs\\u2014that allowed us to make the conclusion in the first place. In this case, too, it just so happens that the value of every term, \\\\( T(n) \\\\), depends on the value of two previous terms, \\\\( T(n - 1) \\\\) and \\\\( T(n - 2) \\\\). This did not happen in our previous examples in this chapter, and it hints at something deeper going on here. Do you see how our previous definition of induction, and the domino analogy, doesn\\u2019t exactly apply here anymore? How might you try to amend our analogy to explain this kind of situation? Think\\n2.4. TWO MORE (DIFFERENT) EXAMPLES\\n\\nabout these issues for a bit and then read on. We\\u2019ll talk about them more in-depth after the next example.\\n\\nBy the way, did you notice something interesting about our solution to this example? Do you know any other sequences of numbers that behave similarly? Think about it . . .\\n\\n2.4.2 Winning Strategies\\n\\nThis example will be our first induction puzzle that doesn\\u2019t prove a numerical formula! It might seem strange to think about that, but it\\u2019s true, as you\\u2019ll see. This is actually more common in mathematics than you might think, too: a problem or mathematical object might have some underlying inductive structure without depending on something algebraic or arithmetic.\\n\\nIn fact, we will be discussing a game. It\\u2019s a game in the usual sense\\u2014there are rules to be followed by two players and there is a clear winner and loser\\u2014but it\\u2019s also a game in the mathematical sense, where we can formulate the rules and playing situations using mathematical notation and discuss formal strategies in an abstract way. We can even solve the game. This is very different than say, the game of baseball.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s discuss the rules for this game, which we shall call \\u201cTakeaway\\u201d, for now. There are two players, called $P_1$ and $P_2$. The player $P_1$ goes first every time. The players start with two piles of stones in the middle of a table, each pile containing exactly $n$ stones, where $n$ is some natural number. (To distinguish the different versions of the game, we will say the players are \\u201cplaying $T_n$\\u201d when there are $n$ stones per pile.) On each player\\u2019s move, they are allowed to remove any number of stones from either pile. It is illegal, though, to remove stones from both piles at once. The player who removes the final stone from the piles is the winner.\\n\\nTry playing Takeaway with some friends. Use pennies or candies or penny candy as stones. Try it for different values of $n$. Try switching roles so you are $P_1$ and then $P_2$. Try to come up with a winning strategy, a method of playing that maximizes your chances of winning. Try to make a conjecture for what happens for different values of $n$. Who is \\u201csupposed\\u201d to win? Can you prove your claim? Seriously, play around with this game and attempt to prove something before reading on for our analysis thereof. You might be surprised by what you can accomplish!\\nAs with the other examples, let\\u2019s use some small values of $n$ to figure out what\\u2019s really going on, then try to generalize. When $n = 1$, this game is rather silly. $P_1$ must empty one pile of its only stone, then $P_2$ gets the only remaining stone in the other pile. Thus, $P_2$ wins. (Notice that it doesn\\u2019t matter which of the two piles $P_1$ picks from, $P_2$ will always get the other one. We might say that $P_1$ picks the pile on the left \\u201cwithout loss of generality\\u201d because it doesn\\u2019t matter either way; the situations are equivalent, so we might as well say it\\u2019s the left pile to have something concrete to say. We will explore this idea of \\u201cwithout loss of generality\\u201d later on when we discuss mathematical logic, too.)\\n\\nWhen $n = 2$, we now have a few cases that might appear. Think about $P_1$\\u2019s possible moves. Again, they might act on either the left or right pile, but because they\\u2019re ultimately identical and we can switch the two piles, let\\u2019s just say (without loss of generality) that $P_1$ removes some stones from the left pile. How many? It could be one or two stones. Let\\u2019s examine each case separately.\\n\\nIf $P_1$ removes both stones, how should $P_2$ react? Duh, they should take the other pile, so $P_1$ probably shouldn\\u2019t have made that move in the first place. However, $P_1$ might not be thinking straight or something and, besides, we need to consider all possible situations here to fully analyze this game. Thus, in this case (the top line in the above diagram) $P_2$ wins. Okay, that\\u2019s the easy situation.\\n\\nWhat if $P_1$ removes just one stone from the left pile (the bottom line above)? How should $P_2$ react? We now have some options:\\n\\n- If $P_2$ removes the other stone from the left pile \\u2026 well, $P_1$ takes the other pile and $P_1$ wins.\\n- If $P_2$ removes both stones from the right pile \\u2026 well, $P_1$ takes the last stone from the left pile and $P_1$ wins.\\n\\u2022 However, if $P_2$ removes just one stone from the right pile \\u2026\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\begin{array}{cccc}\\n\\\\text{P1's turn} & \\\\text{P2's turn} & \\\\text{P1's turn} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{P1 wins!} & \\\\text{P1 wins!} & \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{array} \\\\]\\n\\nNow we have exactly the same situation presented by $T_1$, which we already analyzed! It is, again, $P_1$\\u2019s move first, so we know what will happen: $P_2$ wins no matter what. If you are player $P_2$, this is obviously the best move: you win no matter how $P_1$ responds!\\n\\nStepping back for a second, let\\u2019s think about what this has shown: no matter what $P_1$ does first (remove one or two stones from either pile), there is some possible response that $P_2$ can make that will guarantee a win for $P_2$, regardless of $P_1$\\u2019s subsequent response. Wow, $P_2$ is sitting pretty! Let\\u2019s see if this happens for other values of $n$.\\n\\nWhen $n = 3$, we will again assume (without loss of generality) that player $P_1$ acted on the left pile. They could remove one, two, or three stones:\\n\\n\\u2022 If $P_1$ removes all three, $P_2$ responds by taking the other pile completely and wins.\\n\\n\\u2022 If $P_2$ removes two stones \\u2026 well, what should player $P_2$ do?\\n\\nFinishing off that left pile is stupid (because $P_1$ can take the whole right pile and win), and pulling the entire right pile is similarly stupid (because $P_1$ can take the whole left pile and win), so something in between is required. Now, if $P_2$ removes just one stone from the right pile, notice that $P_1$ can respond with the same action; this leaves exactly one stone in both piles, but the roles reversed. With $P_2$ going first in such a situation, they are now bound to lose, per our previous analysis. Bad move, $P_2$!\\n\\nLet\\u2019s try again. If $P_2$ removes two stones from the right pile instead \\u2026 look at that! We now have exactly one stone in each pile, with $P_1$ up first, so we know $P_1$ is going to lose. $P_2$ strikes again!\\nCHAPTER 2. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION\\n\\nThink about the case where \\\\( n = 4 \\\\) for a minute, and you\\u2019ll find the exact same analysis occurring. You\\u2019ll another possibility to consider: player \\\\( P_1 \\\\) can remove one, or two, or three, or four stones from the left pile. Whatever they do, though, you\\u2019ll find that \\\\( P_2 \\\\) can just mimic that action on the other pile, reducing the whole game to a previous, smaller version of the game, where \\\\( P_2 \\\\) was shown to be guaranteed a win! It looks like \\\\( P_2 \\\\) is in the driver\\u2019s seat the whole time, since they can respond to whatever \\\\( P_1 \\\\) does, making an identical move on the other pile. No matter what \\\\( P_1 \\\\) does, there is always a response for \\\\( P_2 \\\\) that means they win, regardless of \\\\( P_1 \\\\)\\u2019s subsequent moves. In this sense, we say \\u201c\\\\( P_2 \\\\) has a winning strategy\\u201d. There is a clear and describable method for \\\\( P_2 \\\\) to assess the game situation and choose a specific move to guarantee a win.\\n\\nHow might we prove this? How does this even fit into this chapter on induction? It might be hard to see, at the moment. What are we really even proving here? What are the dominoes or rungs in our analogy for this problem? In wrapping your brain around this example, you should hopefully realize the following: induction is not about algebraic formulas all the time; induction represents some kind of \\u201cbuilding-up\\u201d structure, where larger situations depend on smaller ones; we have to prove some initial fact, and then argue how an arbitrary, larger fact can be reduced so that it depends on a previous fact. This is really what the dominoes analogy is meant to accomplish. It just so happens that this analogy is particularly illustrative for certain induction problems (but not all) and is visualizable and memorable. It does not perfectly apply to all situations, though.\\n\\nRead back through these four examples from this chapter and think about how they are similar and how they are different. Try to come up with a more precise, mathematical description of mathematical induction using some better terminology, perhaps of your own invention. (By this, we mean something better than our intuitive analogy. You\\u2019d be surprised at how well you might be able to describe induction without really knowing what you \\u201cought\\u201d to say, and you\\u2019ll actually learn a lot, in the process!) In due time, we will have a rigorous statement to make, and prove, about mathematical induction and its various forms. In the meantime, we need to take a trip through some other areas of mathematics to build up the necessary language, notation, and knowledge to come back and tackle this problem. Before we go, though, we should mention a few useful applications of mathematical induction.\\n2.4.3 Questions & Exercises\\n\\nRemind Yourself\\n\\nAnswering the following questions briefly, either out loud or in writing. These are all based on the section you just read, so if you can\\u2019t recall a specific definition or concept or example, go back and reread that part.

They require you to actually write something down, or describe something out loud (to a friend/classmate, perhaps).

Can you find a winning strategy for either player? Try playing with a friend and see what happens!\\n\\n(4) Look up the Fibonacci numbers. How are they related to the sequence of numbers $T(n)$ we found in the domino tiling example?\\n\\n2.5 Applications\\n\\n2.5.1 Recursive Programming\\n\\nThe concepts behind mathematical induction are employed heavily in computer science, as well. Think back to how we first derived the formula for $\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2$. \\n\\n\\nOnce we had a way to represent a cubic number in terms of a smaller cube and some leftover terms, we repeated this substitution process over and over until we arrived at the \\u201csimplest\\u201d case, namely, the one that we first observed when starting the problem: $2^3 = 1 + 3 + 3 + 1$. Recursive programming takes advantage of this technique: to solve a \\u201clarge\\u201d problem, identify how the problem depends on \\u201csmaller\\u201d cases, and reduce the problem until one reaches a simple, known case.\\n\\nA classical example of this type of technique is seen in writing code to compute the \\\\textit{factorial} function, $n!$, which is defined as the product of the first $n$ natural numbers:\\n\\n$$n! = 1 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdots (n - 1) \\\\cdot n$$\\n\\nThis is a simple definition that we, as humans, intuitively understand, but telling a computer how to perform this product doesn\\u2019t work quite the same way. (Try it! How do you say \\u201cand just keep going until you reach $n$\\u201d in computer code?) A more efficient way to program the function, and one that models the mathematically inductive definition, in fact, is to have one program \\\\textit{recursively call itself} until it reaches that \\u201csimple\\u201d case. With the factorial function, that case is $1! = 1$. For any other value of $n$, we can simply apply the knowledge that\\n\\n$$n! = (n - 1)! \\\\cdot n$$\\n\\nover and over to compute $n!$. Consider the following \\\\textit{pseudocode} that represents this idea:\\n\\n\\\\begin{verbatim}\\nfactorial(n):\\n    if n = 1\\n        return 1\\n    else\\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\\nend\\n\\\\end{verbatim}\\n\\nWe know that $1! = 1$, so if the program is asked to compute that, the correct value is returned right away. For any larger value of $n$, the program refers to \\\\textit{itself} and says, \\u201cGo back and compute $(n - 1)!$ for me, then I\\u2019ll add a factor of $n$ at the end, and we\\u2019ll know the answer.\\u201d To compute $(n - 1)!$, the program asks, again, if the input is 1; if not, it calls itself and says, \\u201cGo back and compute $(n - 2)!$ for me, then I\\u2019ll add a factor of $n - 1$ at the end.\\u201d This process continues until the program returns $1! = 1$. From there, it knows how to find $2! = 1 \\\\times 2$, and then $3! = 2! \\\\times 3$, and so on, until $n! = (n - 1)! \\\\times n$.\\n\\nAnother example involving recursive programming arises with the \\\\textit{Fibonacci numbers}. You may have seen this sequence of numbers before in a mathematics course. (In fact, we even mentioned them in the last section, with the domino tilings!) You also might have heard about how they appear in nature in some interesting and strange ways. (The sequence was first \\u201cdiscovered\\u201d by the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa while studying the growth of rabbit populations.) The first two numbers in the sequence are specified to be 1, and any\\nnumber in the sequence is defined as the sum of the previous two. That is, if we say $F(n)$ represents the $n$-th Fibonacci number, then\\n\\n$$F(1) = 1 \\\\text{ and } F(2) = 1 \\\\text{ and } F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \\\\text{ for every } n \\\\geq 3$$\\n\\nNow, what is $F(5)$? Or $F(100)$? Or $F(10000)$? This can be handled quite easily by a recursive program. The idea is the same: if the program refers to either one of the \\u201csimple cases\\u201d, i.e. $F(1)$ or $F(2)$, then it will know to return the correct value of 1 immediately. Otherwise, it will call itself to compute the previous two numbers and then add those together. Look at the pseudocode below and think about how it works. What would happen if we used this program to compute $F(10)$? How would it figure out the answer?\\n\\n```\\nFibonacci(n):\\n    if n = 1 or n = 2\\n        return 1\\n    else\\n        return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)\\nend\\n```\\n\\nThis follows the same idea as the factorial program above (let the program call itself to compute values for \\u201csmaller\\u201d cases of the function until we reach a known value) but there\\u2019s something a little deeper going on here. If we were to input $n = 10$ into the program, it would recognize that it does not know the output value yet, and it will call itself to compute $Fibonacci(9)$ and $Fibonacci(8)$. In each of those calls to the program, it would again recognize the value is as yet unknown. Thus, it would call upon itself again to compute $Fibonacci(8)$ and $Fibonacci(7)$, but also $Fibonacci(7)$ and $Fibonacci(6)$. That\\u2019s right, the program calls itself multiple times with the same input value. To compute $F(9)$, we need to know $F(8)$ and $F(7)$, but meanwhile, to compute $F(8)$, we also need to know $F(7)$ and $F(6)$. In this way, we end up calling the program $Fibonacci$ many times.\\n\\nTry to compare the programs $Fibonacci$ and $factorial$, especially in regards to the inductive processes we have been investigating in this chapter. Do they use similar ideas? How do they relate to the \\u201cdomino\\u201d analogy of mathematical induction that we outlined? Think of the \\u201cfact\\u201d written on Domino $n$ as being the computation of the correct value of $n!$ or $F(n)$. How does the analogy work in each case? Will all the dominos fall? Keep these questions in mind as you read on. There is some very powerful mathematics underlying all of these ideas.\\n\\n### 2.5.2 The Tower of Hanoi\\n\\nLet\\u2019s take a short break and play a game. Well, it\\u2019s not exactly a break because this is, in a sense, an inductive game, so it\\u2019s completely relevant. But it is a\\ngame, nevertheless! The Tower of Hanoi is a very popular puzzle, partly because it involves such simple equipment and rules. Solving it is another matter, though!\\n\\nImagine that we have three vertical rods and three disks of three different sizes (colored blue, green, and red) stacked upon each other like so:\\n\\nThe goal is to move all three disks to another rod (either the middle or the right one, it doesn\\u2019t matter) by following these rules:\\n\\n1. A single move consists of moving one (and only one) disk from the top of the stack on any rod and moving it to the top of the stack on another rod.\\n2. A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s it! Two simple rules, but a difficult game to play. Try modeling the game with a few coins or playing cards or whatever you have handy. (You can even buy Tower of Hanoi sets at some games stores.) Can you solve it? How many moves did it take you? Is your solution the \\u201cbest\\u201d one? Why or why not?\\n\\nWe mentioned that this is an inductive game, so let\\u2019s explore that idea now. We want to consider how many moves it takes to solve the puzzle (where one move accounts for moving one disk from one rod to another) and, more specifically, identify the smallest possible number of moves it would take to solve the puzzle. To solve the puzzle with three disks, we could keep moving the smallest disk back and forth between two rods and generate 100 moves, if we wanted to, and then solve it, but that\\u2019s certainly not the best way to do it, right? Let\\u2019s say we found a way to solve the puzzle in a certain number of moves; how could we show that the number of moves we used is the smallest possible number of moves?\\n\\nTo address this question, we want to break down the method of solving the puzzle recursively. In doing so, we are actually going to answer a far more general question: What is the smallest number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with $n$ disks on 3 rods? We posed the puzzle above with just 3 disks to give you a concrete version to think about and work with, but we can answer this more general question by thinking carefully. To make sure we are on the same page, we will show you how we solved the version with 3 disks:\\nNotice that the largest disk is essentially \\u201cirrelevant\\u201d for most of the solution. Since we are allowed to place any other disk on top of it, all we need to do is \\u201cuncover\\u201d that disk by moving the other disks onto a different rod, move the largest disk to the only empty rod, then move the other disks on top of the large one. In essence, we perform the same procedure (shifting the two smaller disks from one rod to another) twice and, in between those, we move the large disk from one rod to another. If the largest disk hadn\\u2019t been there at all, what we actually did was solve the version of the puzzle with 2 disks, but twice! (Think carefully about this and make sure you see why this is true. Follow along with the moves in the diagrams above and pretend the large, blue disk isn\\u2019t there.)\\n\\nThis shows that the way to solve the 3-disk puzzle involves two iterations of solving the 2-disk puzzle, with one extra move in between (moving the largest disk). This indicates a recursive procedure to solve the puzzle, in general. To optimally solve the \\\\( n \\\\)-disk puzzle, we would simply follow the procedure to optimally solve the \\\\((n-1)\\\\)-disk puzzle, use one move to shift the largest, \\\\( n \\\\)-th disk, then solve the \\\\((n-1)\\\\)-disk puzzle again.\\n\\nNow that we have some insight into how to optimally solve the puzzle, let\\u2019s identify how many moves that procedure requires. Recognizing that solving this puzzle uses a recursive algorithm, we realize that proving anything about the optimal solution will require induction. Accordingly, we would need to identify a \\u201cstarting point\\u201d for our line of dominos, and it should correspond to the \\u201csmallest\\u201d or \\u201csimplest\\u201d version of the puzzle. For the Tower of Hanoi, this is the 1-disk puzzle. Of course, this is hardly a \\u201cpuzzle\\u201d because we can solve it in one move, by simply shifting the only disk from one rod to any other rod. If we let \\\\( M(n) \\\\) represent the number of moves required to optimally solve the \\\\( n \\\\)-disk puzzle, then we\\u2019ve just identified \\\\( M(1) = 1 \\\\). To identify \\\\( M(2) \\\\), we can use our observation from the previous paragraph and say that\\n\\n\\\\[\\nM(2) = M(1) + 1 + M(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand then it must be that\\n\\n\\\\[\\nM(3) = M(2) + 1 + M(2) = 3 + 1 + 3 = 7\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\\\[\\nM(4) = M(3) + 1 + M(3) = 7 + 1 + 7 = 15\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand so on. Do you notice a pattern yet? Each of these numbers is one less than a power of 2, and specifically, we notice that \\\\( M(n) = 2^n - 1 \\\\), for each of the cases we have seen thus far. It\\u2019s important to point out that observing this pattern doesn\\u2019t prove the pattern; just because it works for the first 4 cases does not mean the trend will continue, but that\\u2019s exactly what an induction proof would accomplish. Also, recognizing that pattern and \\u201cobserving\\u201d that \\\\( M(n) = 2^n - 1 \\\\) is a non-trivial matter, itself. We happened to know the answer and had no problem identifying the formula for you. You should probably try, on your own, to \\u201csolve\\u201d the following relationship\\n\\n\\\\[\\nM(n) = 2M(n-1) + 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad M(1) = 1\\n\\\\]\\nand see if you can derive the formula \\\\( M(n) = 2^n - 1 \\\\). The reason such a formula is nicer than the above relationship is that, now, \\\\( M(n) \\\\) depends only on \\\\( n \\\\), and not on previous terms (like \\\\( M(n-1) \\\\), for example). This relationship and others like it are known as recurrence relations, and they can be rather difficult to solve, in general!\\n\\nWe know how to solve this one, though, and it yields \\\\( M(n) = 2^n - 1 \\\\). We will leave it to you to verify this. You can do so by checking a few values in the equation above, but we all know that isn\\u2019t a proof. Try working through the inductive steps to actually prove it! We have already done most of the work, but it will be up to you to arrange everything carefully and clearly. Remember that you should identify what the \\u201cfact\\u201d on each domino is, ensure that Domino 1 falls, and then make a general argument about Domino \\\\( n \\\\) toppling into Domino \\\\( (n+1) \\\\). Try to write that proof. Do the details make sense to you? Try showing your proof to a friend and see if they understand it. Did you need to tell them anything else or guide them through it? Think about the best way to explain your method and steps so that the written version suffices and you don\\u2019t have to add any verbal explanations.\\n\\n2.5.3 Questions & Exercises\\n\\nRemind Yourself\\n\\nAnswering the following questions briefly, either out loud or in writing. These are all based on the section you just read, so if you can\\u2019t recall a specific definition or concept or example, go back and reread that part. Making sure you can confidently answer these before moving on will help your understanding and memory!\\n\\n(1) How is a recursive program inductive?\\n\\n(2) What is the inductive structure of the Tower of Hanoi?

They require you to actually write something down, or describe something out loud (to a friend/classmate, perhaps). The goal is to get you to practice working with new concepts, definitions, and notation. They are meant to be easy, though; making sure you can work through them will help you!\\n\\n(1) Follow the steps of the pseudocode factorial to compute \\\\( 5! \\\\).\\n\\n(2) Follow the steps of the pseudocode Fibonacci to compute \\\\( F(5) \\\\).\\n\\n(3) Solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 4 disks. Make sure that you can do it in the optimal number of moves, \\\\( 2^4 - 1 = 15 \\\\).\\n2.6 Summary\\n\\nWe have now seen some examples of inductive arguments. We realized that some of the puzzles we were solving used similar argument styles, and explored several examples to get a flavor for the different issues that might come up in such arguments. Specifically, we saw how inductive arguments are not always about proving a summation formula or an equation: inductive arguments can apply to any situation where a fact depends on a \\u201cprevious instance\\u201d of that fact. This led us into developing an analogy for how induction works, mathematically speaking. We are comfortable with thinking of induction in terms of the \\u201cDomino Analogy\\u201d for now, but one of our main goals in moving forwards is rigorously stating and proving a principle of induction. For now, let\\u2019s get lots of practice working with these kinds of arguments. This is what this chapter\\u2019s exercises are meant to achieve. Later on, once we\\u2019ve formalized induction, we\\u2019ll be better off for it, and we\\u2019ll have a thorough understanding of the concept!\\n\\n2.7 Chapter Exercises\\n\\nHere are some problems to get you comfortable working with inductive-style arguments. We aren\\u2019t looking for fully rigorous proofs here, just a good description of what is going on and a write-up of your steps. We\\u2019ll come back to some of these later and rigorously prove them, once we\\u2019ve established the Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI) and a corresponding proof strategy.\\n\\nProblem 2.7.1.

A binary \\\\( n \\\\)-tuple is an ordered string of 0s and 1s, with \\\\( n \\\\) total numbers in the string.

Recall that the Fibonacci Numbers are defined by setting \\\\( f_0 = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( f_1 = 1 \\\\) and then, for every \\\\( n \\\\geq 2 \\\\), setting \\\\( f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} \\\\). This produces the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, \\\\ldots\\n\\nYou might not know that the Fibonacci Numbers also have a closed form; that is, there is a specific formula that defines them, in addition to the usual recursive definition given above. Here it is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nf_n = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{5}} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\\\right)^n - \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 - \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\\\right)^n \\\\right]\\n\\\\]\\n\\nProve that this formula is correct for all values of \\\\( n \\\\geq 0 \\\\).\\n\\nProblem 2.7.15.

What is wrong with the following \\u201cspoof\\u201d that all pens have the same color.\\n\\n\\u201cSpoof\\u201d: Consider a group of pens with size 1. Since there is only 1 pen, it certainly has the same color as itself.\\n\\nAssume that any group of $n$ pens has only one color represented inside the group. (Note: we explained why this assumption is valid for $n = 1$ already, so we can make this assumption.) Take any group of $n+1$ pens. Line them up on a table and number them from 1 to $n+1$, left to right. Look at the first $n$ of them, i.e. look at pens 1, 2, 3, ..., $n$. This is a group of $n$ pens so, by assumption, there is only one color represented in the group. (We don\\u2019t know what color that is yet.) Then, look at the last $n$ of the pens; i.e. look at pens 2, 3, ..., $n+1$. This is also a group of $n$ pens so, by assumption, there is only one color represented in this group, too. Now, pen #2 happens to belong to both of these groups. Thus, whatever color pen #2 is, that is also the color of every pen in both groups. Thus, all $n+1$ pens have the same color.\\n\\nBy induction, this shows that any group of pens, of any size, has only one color represented. Looking at the finite collection of pens in the world, then, we should only find one color.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u25a1\\u201d\\n\\nProblem 2.7.19. \\u2605 This problem is extremely difficult to analyze, and is taken from the blog of the famous mathematician Terence Tao (link here).\\n\\nThere is an island upon which a tribe resides. The tribe consists of 1000 people, with various eye colours. Yet, their religion forbids them to know their own eye color, or even to discuss the topic; thus, each resident can (and does) see the eye colors of all other residents, but has no way of discovering his or her own (there are no reflective surfaces). If a tribesperson does discover his or her own eye color, then their religion compels them to commit ritual suicide at noon the following day in the village square for all to witness. All the tribespeople are highly logical and devout, and they all know that each other is also highly logical and devout (and they all know that each other is highly logical and devout, and so forth).\\n\\n(For the purposes of this logic puzzle, \\u201dhighly logical\\u201d means that any conclusion that can logically deduced from the information and observations available to an islander, will automatically be known to that islander.)\\n\\nOf the 1000 islanders, it turns out that 100 of them have blue eyes and 900 of them have brown eyes, although the islanders are not initially aware of these statistics (each of them can of course only see 999 of the 1000 tribespeople).\\n\\nOne day, a blue-eyed foreigner visits to the island and wins the complete trust of the tribe.\\n\\nOne evening, he addresses the entire tribe to thank them for their hospitality.\\n\\nHowever, not knowing the customs, the foreigner makes the mistake of mentioning eye color in his address, remarking how unusual it is to see another blue-eyed person like myself in this region of the world.\\n\\nWhat effect, if anything, does this faux pas have on the tribe?\\n2.8 Lookahead\\n\\nIn this chapter, we have introduced you to the concept of mathematical induction. We looked at a few examples of puzzles where an inductive process guided our solution, and then we described how a proof by induction would follow to rigorously verify that solution. With the mathematical techniques and concepts we have at hand thus far, we had to rely on a non-technical analogy to describe this process to you. Thinking of an infinite line of dominos with \\u201cfacts\\u201d written on them knocking into each other is a perfectly reasonable interpretation of this process, but it fails to represent the full mathematical extent of induction. In a way, it\\u2019s like having a friend describe to you how to swing a golf club, even though you\\u2019ve never played golf before. Sure, they can provide you with some mental imagery of what a swing \\u201cfeels like\\u201d, but without getting out there and practicing yourself, how will you truly understand the mechanics of the golf swing? How will you learn how to adapt your swing, or tell the differences between using a driver and a five iron and a sand wedge? By investigating the underlying mechanics and practicing with those concepts, we hope to gain a better understanding of mathematical induction so that, in the future, we can use it appropriately, identify situations where it would be useful, and, eventually, learn how to adapt it to other situations. Of course, it will help to have that domino analogy in mind to guide our intuition, but we should also remember that it is not rigorous mathematics. It also doesn\\u2019t perfectly describe the other examples we discussed, where a falling domino depended on not only the one immediately behind it, but several others before it.\\n\\nIn the next chapter, we will explore some relevant concepts needed to rigorously state and prove mathematical induction as a proof technique. Specifically, we will study some ideas of mathematical logic and investigate how to break down complicated mathematical statements and theorems into their constituent parts, and also how to build interesting and complex statements out of basic building blocks. Along the way, we will introduce some new notation and shorthand that will let us condense some of the wordy statements we make into concise (and precise) mathematical language. With that in hand, we will explore some more fundamental proof strategies, that we will then apply to everything else we do in this course, including the induction technique, itself! We will also study some of the ideas of set theory, a branch of mathematics that forms the foundation for all other branches. This will be extremely useful for organizing our ideas in the future, but it will also help us define the natural numbers in a rigorous manner. With some concepts and knowledge from these two branches of mathematics under our collective belts, we will be able to build mathematical induction on a solid foundation and continue to use it properly.\", \"source\": \"olmocr\", \"added\": \"2025-03-05\", \"created\": \"2025-03-05\", \"metadata\": {\"Source-File\": \"tests/gnarly_pdfs/bws_book_ch2.pdf\", \"olmocr-version\": \"0.1.59\", \"pdf-total-pages\": 48, \"total-input-tokens\": 126176, \"total-output-tokens\": 29628, \"total-fallback-pages\": 0}, \"attributes\": {\"pdf_page_numbers\": [[0, 1770, 1], [1770, 4531, 2], [4531, 7542, 3], [7542, 10012, 4], [10012, 11065, 5], [11065, 12117, 6], [12117, 12823, 7], [12823, 14162, 8], [14162, 16917, 9], [16917, 19160, 10], [19160, 21611, 11], [21611, 24696, 12], [24696, 25893, 13], [25893, 27667, 14], [27667, 30494, 15], [30494, 32438, 16], [32438, 35106, 17], [35106, 37404, 18], [37404, 40008, 19], [40008, 41554, 20], [41554, 43386, 21], [43386, 45645, 22], [45645, 47659, 23], [47659, 50584, 24], [50584, 53340, 25], [53340, 56394, 26], [56394, 59387, 27], [59387, 61139, 28], [61139, 63261, 29], [63261, 64219, 30], [64219, 65935, 31], [65935, 67860, 32], [67860, 70225, 33], [70225, 72125, 34], [72125, 74015, 35], [74015, 76749, 36], [76749, 78781, 37], [78781, 81537, 38], [81537, 84074, 39], [84074, 86281, 40], [86281, 86281, 41], [86281, 89314, 42], [89314, 91756, 43], [91756, 93937, 44], [93937, 96184, 45], [96184, 98405, 46], [98405, 101465, 47], [101465, 104422, 48]]}}\n",

DISCOVERY WORLD contains a variety of different challenges, covering topics as diverse as radioisotope dating, rocket science, and proteomics, to encourage development of general discovery skills rather than task-specific solutions. DISCOVERY WORLD itself is an inexpensive, simulated, text-based environment (with optional 2D visual overlay). It includes 120 different challenge tasks, spanning eight topics each with three levels of difficulty and several parametric variations. Each task requires an agent to form hypotheses, design and run experiments, analyze results, and act on conclusions. DISCOVERY WORLD further provides three automatic metrics for evaluating performance, based on (a) task completion, (b) task-relevant actions taken, and (c) the discovered explanatory knowledge. We find that strong baseline agents, that perform well in prior published environments, struggle on most DISCOVERY WORLD tasks, suggesting that DISCOVERY WORLD captures some of the novel challenges of discovery, and thus that DISCOVERY WORLD may help accelerate near-term development and assessment of scientific discovery competency in agents.

Recently, with the rise of neural techniques, there have been several successful discovery systems developed for specialized problems such as protein folding [10] [15], mathematics [22], and material science [24]. However, while the results have been impressive, these systems (deliberately) bypass the full discovery process of ideation, hypothesis formation, experiment design, etc., and instead (expertly) perform systematic searches over a pre-defined hypothesis space, with pre-defined goals. This raises the question: how much more can be achieved if AI is applied to the broader scientific process? Some works have indeed developed early systems for this, for example, in chemistry [11], and genetics [12]. These systems can also generate hypotheses, design experiments, and execute them (via robotics) in real environments. However, operating in real environments is expensive and complex, creating a barrier\\n\\n1Released under Apache-2.0 license.\\nFigure 1: DISCOVERY WORLD is a virtual environment for developing and evaluating discovery agents, with challenge tasks covering a broad variety of different topics such as those shown above.\\n\\nfor entry. In addition, real environments inevitably encourage a focus on task-specific details, at the potential cost of developing more general discovery skills in an agent.\\n\\nOur goal is to help remedy these by creating the first virtual discovery environment where solving tasks demands all of the key facets in end-to-end scientific discovery and which covers a broad variety of discovery topics. Our approach is to develop a text-based simulated world (with optional 2D visual overlay), called DISCOVERY WORLD, where agents can navigate around, interact with objects in the world, use scientific equipment (measuring devices, tools, etc.), and make observations. Agents can then form hypotheses, plan and execute experiments, and draw conclusions to solve challenge tasks developed for this virtual world. DISCOVERY WORLD tasks are grounded in eight varied topics, such as radioisotope dating, rocket science, and proteomics, to encourage development of agents with general discovery skills rather than hard-wiring to a particular challenge (see Figure 1). The tasks themselves are realistic (but simplified), allowing agents to apply both scientific and commonsense knowledge when attempting them. DISCOVERY WORLD thus provides an environment for exercising and evaluating general-purpose skills in end-to-end AI discovery systems (see Figure 2).\\n\\nDISCOVERY WORLD is inspired by a growing number of text-based simulation environments, while also being novel in both its environment and tasks:\\n\\n\\u2022 DISCOVERY WORLD tasks are long-horizon, requiring multiple facets of discovery including ideation, experimentation, systematic search, and analysis to be performed to solve a task.\\n\\u2022 The tasks do not suggest a solution approach, instead requiring the agent to ideate and define hypotheses to explore. This contrasts with tasks in many adventure game environments where solution approaches are often more stylistic or constrained.\\n\\u2022 DISCOVERY WORLD is realistic (but simplified) rather than counterfactual, so that background knowledge can be sensibly applied.\\n\\u2022 The tasks cover eight diverse topics, from identifying the cause of space illnesses to reactor tuning, to encourage development of general rather than task-specific solutions.\\n\\nFinally, automatically evaluating an agent\\u2019s progress on a discovery task is itself challenging. We devise a three-part evaluation strategy to help with this, more on this in Section 3.4.\\n\\nOur contributions are thus:\\n\\n2While a precise definition of \\\"scientific discovery\\\" is somewhat elusive [17, 19], we here adopt a pragmatic approach: Our goal is to help develop systems that can perform the end-to-end research process that human scientists engage in as they work on a problem, attempt to answer a question, or more generally advance their field of study. We use the term \\u201cscientific discovery\\u201d here to refer to this process.\\n**Task Description:** The Colonists on PlanetX are becoming sick after they eat local food.

However, these systems are expensive and task-specific. Inspired by these, DISCOVERYWORLD aims to be a broad coverage, virtual environment allowing general scientific research skills to be developed and evaluated. There are many virtual environments that touch on aspects of the discovery process (see Table 1), although DISCOVERYWORLD is the first aimed at the full end-to-end pipeline:\\n\\nMany physical simulation environments were developed (e.g., for robotics), focusing on object manipulation and navigation. Some are visual/spatial environments (e.g., AI2-Thor [14], ALFRED [25]), while others are textual/symbolic (e.g., TextWorld [5], MiniGrid [4], ALFWorld [26]).\\n\\nMany game worlds require exploration and discovery, e.g., NetHack [16], MineDojo [6]. However, these operate in counterfactual worlds where good scientific choices are not always rewarded, and are primarily aimed at entertainment.\\n\\nSome virtual environments (abstractly) cover real world tasks. WebArena [36] simulates Web-based activities, e.g., browsing for a phone number, on-line shopping, aiming to improve an agent\\u2019s task-specific Web navigation skills. Perhaps closest to DISCOVERYWORLD is ScienceWorld [31], a text-based environment for solving simple science quests known to elementary science students, such as \\u201cconvert a liquid into a solid\\u201d (e.g., put water in the freezer). ScienceWorld requires commonsense object manipulation at the level of an elementary science student, but not ideation or systematic search to complete tasks. In contrast, we show that DISCOVERYWORLD contains discovery tasks that are challenging even for human scientists with PHDs in the natural sciences.\\n\\nFinally, some environments are explicitly designed to host hypothesis search. Alchemy [28] is a 3D video game to find which mixture of potions transforms a stone into a more valuable form.\\nTable 1: A comparison of existing virtual environments with DISCOVERY WORLD. Note that to control for spatial complexity across environments, for the purposes of counting actions, move actions are considered single actions (i.e. move [dir]). Information in this table has been pieced together by looking at the different source materials for each environment (e.g., paper, website, and codebase). These should be taken as our best estimate.\\n\\n| Environment       | Multi-modal | Domain       | # of Tasks | Parametric Props. | # of Actions | Task Length |\\n|-------------------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|\\n| MINIGRID          | Image/Symbol| Pick+Place   | 23         | Yes               | 4            | 4           | 85          |\\n| ALFRED            | Image       | Pick+Place   | 6          | Yes               | 20           | 7           | 50          |\\n| ALFWORLD          | Text/Image  | Pick+Place   | 6          | Yes               | 16           | 9           | 10          |\\n| MINEZONE          | Text/Image  | Minecraft    | 10         | Yes               | 25\\u00b16         | 12          | 100k        |\\n| NETHEALD          | Text/Image  | Dungeon      | 7          | Yes               | 69           | 78          | 80k         |\\n| ALCHEMY           | Image/Symbol| Chemistry    | 1          | Yes               | 3            | 9           | 200         |\\n| IVRE              | Image/Symbol| Hypothesis Testing | 1 | Yes | 3 | 9 | 10 |\\n| SCIENCEWORLD      | Text        | Elem.

These environments exercise the systematic search part of the discovery pipeline. Likewise, MLAgentBench [8] requires software experiments to solve a challenge (improve a ML algorithm), but in the constrained environment of ML software. In contrast, DISCOVERY WORLD aims to cover a broad range of tasks in a (simulated) physical environment, covering the full end-to-end discovery pipeline.\\n\\n3 DISCOVERY WORLD Simulator and Environments\\n\\n3.1 Simulator\\n\\nEngine: DISCOVERY WORLD is implemented in a custom simulation engine developed from the ground-up to enable building dynamic discovery simulations with a variety of object properties and simulated object behaviors. Every object in DISCOVERY WORLD is constructed from materials with measurable properties, many of which are observable with instruments available in the environment (a list of 60+ frequent object properties is provided in APPENDIX C.5). The simulator is implemented as approximately 20K lines of PYTHON using the PyGAME framework [21], and provides both an API for developing agents, as well as a graphical user interface for humans to play DISCOVERY WORLD tasks. The API resembles the OpenAI GYM specifications [3,27], such that at each step, the agent\\n\\n---\\n\\n1 We only considered programmatic tasks as they can be measured accurately. Then, we only count the (sub)categories since most programmatic tasks are parametric variations of those.\\nis provided with an observation from the environment, and must choose a single action to take during that turn from a set of possible actions. An automatic scorer runs in the background, and a given task continues until either it is solved, or the agent/human ends the simulation.\\n\\nEnvironment Space: All current environments are represented as a $32 \\\\times 32$ tile grid. As in text game simulators, all objects at a given tile are represented by an object tree, where the root node contains objects that are directly on the environment tile (such as a table), while child nodes of each object contain their contents (such as a jar on the table).\\n\\nObservations: Observations in DISCOVERYWORLD can be provided as text, visual output, or both. Text observations are provided as JSON and contain the following: (1) a list of all objects near the agent, their names, text descriptions, and unique identifier numbers; (2) a list of objects in the agent\\u2019s inventory; (3) a list of objects the agent can directly interact with (either by being in the agents inventory, or directly beside the agent); (4) the agent\\u2019s current world location, direction, and directions it can move to (that are not blocked by objects); (5) whether the agent is currently engaged in dialog with another agent, and if so, what pre-determined options it can say; (6) the current task description, and whether or not it has been completed. For tasks that require interacting with other agents (such as Space Sick), we also implemented DiscoveryFeed, a Twitter-like posting environment that reduces the need for an agent to continually visit other agents to check on their status. The most recent DiscoveryFeed posts are included in the observation.\\n\\nThe visual observation contains a screenshot (768px $\\\\times$ 512px) similar to the user interface, which provides a $24 \\\\times 16$ tile view of the world (each tile is 32px $\\\\times$ 32px) centered on the agent (see Fig 4 in the APPENDIX). This provides information about objects that are farther away than the JSON observation, which is typically limited to a certain distance (configurable, default within 3 tiles) around the agent due to the size (in tokens) of the objects and their associated descriptions.\\n\\nAction space: DISCOVERYWORLD includes 14 possible actions, most of which are common actions such as taking, dropping, or moving objects, opening/closing objects, activating/deactivating objects, using one object on another, and other actions found in other simulated environments. Each action can take zero (e.g. wait), one (e.g. take seed), or two (e.g. use spectrometer on plant) arguments. A list of all actions is shown in APPENDIX C. For agents, we include two additional handicap actions to assist with their (generally) poor abilities for navigation: the ability to teleport to specific task-relevant named locations provided in each task (such as the science lab or cafeteria), and the ability to teleport directly beside any object it is currently (or has previously) observed.\\n\\n3.2 Discovery Task Themes, Difficulty Levels, and Parametric Variations\\n\\nSpecific tasks in DISCOVERYWORLD are parametrically generated from a set of 24 high-level templates. These templates are divided into 8 discovery task themes with 3 levels of difficulty for each theme. A high-level description of the 8 discovery task themes is shown in Table 2 with full details (including spoilers) in APPENDIX C. For each of the 24 theme $\\\\times$ difficulty combinations, the DISCOVERYWORLD simulator is capable of generating a large number of parametric versions of that theme that constitute a particular instance of a task. These parametric variations vary the specific task solution, which typically involves dynamically generating new values for specific object properties, and/or substituting in different task objects. For example, in the Proteomics theme, each parametric variation of a given task generates a different clustering problem, with different data, that points to a different animal as the solution, and places the animals at different starting locations within the environment. Parametric variation generation is deterministic and controlled by a single random seed provided to the task generator. While a large number of specific instantiations of each theme are possible, due to the cost associated with evaluating a large number of tasks, our official benchmark is evaluated on 5 seeds (i.e., random seeds zero through four) for each theme and difficulty level, resulting in a total of $8 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 = 120$ different game instances or tasks.\\n\\n3.3 Unit Tests\\n\\nIn addition to the 8 discovery themes, to help disentangle whether a given model\\u2019s performance is due to a difficulty in completing normal day-to-day tasks within the environment, versus completing tasks requiring scientific discovery skills in particular, we include 10 additional unit test themes that...\\nTable 3: An example scorecard provided by DISCOVERYWORLD for an instance of a Reactor Lab task, including task completion, task process, and discovered explanatory knowledge scores.\\n\\n| Scorecard: Reactor Lab, Normal Difficulty, Seed 1 | Out of |\\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\\n| **Task Completion:** Was the task completed successfully? | 1/1 |\\n| **Procedural Process:** | |\\n| P1 The quantum crystals have each been in an agent\\u2019s inventory | 4/4 |\\n| P2 Each scientific instrument has been used with at least one crystal | 4/5 |\\n| P3 Each crystal has been examined by the critical instrument | 4/4 |\\n| P4 The resonance frequency of the unknown reactors have been changed | 2/2 |\\n| P5 The resonance frequency of the unknown reactors is correct | 2/2 |\\n| P6 The reactors have been successfully activated | 4/4 |\\n| **Total Procedural Score:** | 25/25 |\\n| **Explanatory Knowledge Discovery Questions:** | |\\n| Q1 Does it clearly state that the resonance frequency of the crystals is dependent upon the densitometer reading? | 1/1 |\\n| Q2 Does it clearly state that the relationship is linear, with crystal frequency = (96 * densitometer reading) + 102 | 1/1 |\\n| **Total Discovery Knowledge Score:** | 2/2 |\\n\\ntest specific common task competencies. These include a combination of common pick-and-place and navigation tasks (such as those found in ALF WORLD [26], MINI GRID [4], and MINI HACK [23]), as well as DISCOVERYWORLD-themed tasks, such as measuring objects with instruments, or having multi-turn interactions with other agents. The unit test generator is also parametric and capable of generating a large number of specific tasks for each unit test theme. Specific unit test themes are described in detail in APPENDIX C.4.\\n\\n3.4 Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nTo evaluate agents progress in DISCOVERYWORLD, we devised three automatic metrics: (1) task completion (a binary metric); (2) a fine-grained report card for each task tracking task-relevant actions, to measure partial performance on relevant discovery procedures; (3) the accuracy of discovered explanatory knowledge with respect to a gold reference. Together these allow an agent\\u2019s progress (including partial progress) to be automatically assessed. An example scorecard is shown in Table 3.\\n\\nTwo of these three metrics (task completion, and task process) are measured automatically by DISCOVERYWORLD. For the third, discovered explanatory knowledge, the scorecard provides specific binary questions to answer with reference to knowledge that an agent has produced (in its explanations, memories, reports, or other knowledge structures). These can either be graded manually by a human, or provided to a language model to grade. DISCOVERYWORLD provides code for automatic grading using OPENAI models, and in our evaluation we make use of GPT-4, a long-context (128k token) model that allows even large knowledge structures to be graded. Examples of both positive and negative knowledge assessments are provided in APPENDIX E.\\n\\n4 Experiments, Baseline Agents, and Human Baselines\\n\\nIn this section we examine the performance of strong baseline agents on each of the DISCOVERYWORLD tasks. In addition, we investigate the performance of human scientists, and highlight the performance gap between current agent models and real human scientists.\\n\\n4.1 Experimental setup\\n\\nFor the purposes of this work, we seek to better understand the zero-shot generalization performance of AI agents on tasks that require iterative scientific discovery: that is, coming up with hypotheses, doing in-game experiments to (in)validate them, then arriving at a discovered solution for the task. As such, we evaluate the performance of three contemporary baselines in a zero-shot setting (though single-task, multi-task, or curriculum learning settings with separate training and evaluation sets are possible with this benchmark; see APPENDIX C.2 for these configurations). In the zero-shot setting, an agent has no prior exposure to DISCOVERYWORLD, and is evaluated on all 120 tasks.

Scientists were recruited on the UpWork platform, each with: (1) an MSC or PHD in a natural science, (2) self-evaluated comfort and fluency with statistical methods and common software like spreadsheets, (3) comfort and previous experience with 2D top-down games. Additional details regarding human participant experiments are provided in APPENDIX F.\\n5 Discussion\\n\\nHuman Performance  As shown in Table 6, discovery task completion rates varied from tasks that were solved by all participants, to several Challenge difficulty tasks that were solved by only a single participant, highlighting the range of difficulties found across task themes, and range of expertise provided by each scientist. Overall, the average completion rate across tasks was 66%, with 11 of 16 tasks performed by humans having completion rates exceeding 60%. Average knowledge performance was slightly lower at 55%, reflecting that when stuck, the humans sometimes attempted brute force solutions to tasks that may have eventually yielded correct answers (e.g. trying all possible crystal frequencies, if they didn\\u2019t use regression to fit the data), but without producing the required explanatory discovery.\\n\\nAgent Performance  In contrast to human scientists, the baseline agent scientists exhibited poor overall performance, as shown in Table 4. The most performant discovery agent (REACT) completed 38% of easy tasks and 18% of challenge tasks, while the agent that best discovered explanatory knowledge (HYPOTHEZIZER) discovered only 34% of gold knowledge in easy tasks, and only 8% in challenge tasks. An analysis of these agents performance on the Unit Test tasks (Table 5) shows moderate overall performance, with completion rates in the 60%+ range, suggesting that current agents are competent at many of the components of scientific discovery \\u2013 like measuring objects with instruments \\u2013 but currently lack the capacity to perform end-to-end discovery in most DISCOVERY WORLD settings.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe have presented DISCOVERY WORLD, the first virtual environment for developing and benchmarking an agent\\u2019s ability to perform end-to-end scientific discovery. Each of the 120 tasks requires an agent to form hypotheses, design and run experiments, analyze results, and act on conclusions. We empirically demonstrate that expert human scientists find the challenge tasks in DISCOVERY WORLD difficult but solvable, while strong agent baselines struggle to complete most tasks, or discover critical explanatory knowledge. We hope DISCOVERY WORLD will inspire and accelerate the development of new, general AI discovery agents by the community.\\n\\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\\n\\nWe thank members of the Aristo and Semantic Scholar teams at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence for their helpful comments and support throughout the development of this work.

As such, agents that perform well on DISCOVERYWORLD may not necessarily perform well at making discoveries in the real world, given the much larger search and action space. That being said, while the simulated environment is low-fidelity compared to the physical world, the steps of discovery that are simulated (from ideation, hypothesis formation, experiment design and execution, data analysis, and forming conclusions) are common steps in the scientific method regardless of whether those actions are taking place in the real world or a virtual environment.\\n\\nAgent Cost: The agent models that we run are currently quite costly, ranging from approximately USD$3k-$10k to run for the complete set of 120 tasks in DISCOVERYWORLD. This cost is due in large part to (1) the long (1000+ steps) runtimes, each step requiring at least one LLM call, (2) the large number of individual tasks to evaluate, and (3) the use of performant but costly API-BASED models that charge per token. We believe that developing inexpensive models that allow for rapid iteration is a clear near-term goal for developing further discovery agents.\\n\\nSocietal Benefits and Risks: Automated scientific discovery has the potential for broadly positive societal impact by accelerating the pace of scientific progress, potentially decreasing the time it takes for novel discoveries in medicine, chemistry, technology, and other areas of broad impact. If discovery systems are used by individuals or groups with prosocial intentions, there is the potential for broad societal impact. Conversely, if individuals or groups with negative intentions choose to attempt to accelerate discoveries that may be harmful, there is the potential for those individuals or groups to cause harm using automated scientific discovery models.\\n\\nC Additional Details on DISCOVERYWORLD\\n\\nTo encourage the community to work on general AI discovery agents, we have open-sourced DISCOVERYWORLD under Apache-2.0 license on GitHub at [github.com/allenai/discoveryworld](https://github.com/allenai/discoveryworld).\\n\\nC.1 Action Space\\n\\nThe action space for DISCOVERYWORLD is shown in Table 7.\\n\\n| Action             | Description          | Action                | Description                      |\\n|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|\\n| MOVE DIR           | Move North           | USE OBJ [ON OBJ]      | Use spectrometer on soil         |\\n| TAKE OBJ           | Take thermometer     | EAT OBJ               | Eat mushroom                     |\\n| DROP OBJ           | Drop seed            | READ OBJ              | Read rocketry book               |\\n| PUT/GIVE OBJ TO OBJ| Put sample in jar    | WAIT                  | Do nothing                       |\\n| OPEN/CLOSE OBJ     | Open door            | FEED                  | View DiscoveryFeed               |\\n| DE/ACTIVATE OBJ    | Activate pendulum    | TELEPORT LOC *        | Teleport to Science Lab          |\\n| TALK OBJ           | Talk to Colonist     | TELEPORT OBJ *        | Teleport to Microscope           |\\n\\nC.2 Experimental Settings\\n\\nAs both a development environment and benchmarking tool, we provide the following recommended configurations for evaluating on DISCOVERYWORLD in common experimental settings:\\n\\n**Zero-shot:** For zero-shot evaluation, an agent should not have prior exposure to DISCOVERYWORLD, and can be evaluated on all 120 tasks. Each task should be evaluated independently, without any carry-over knowledge from one task to another. All of the baseline agent models provided in this work are evaluated zero-shot.\\nSingle-Task Learning: For agents that require training data (e.g., RL agents, few-shot examples, etc.) of highly similar tasks (i.e., within-task designs), following the TextWorld [5], ALFWorld [26], and SCIENCEWorld [30] conventions, we recommend the following within-theme design: training on parametric seeds 0 and 1, developing on seed 2, and testing on seeds 3 and 4. In addition, all tasks in the Unit Tests are available for training.\\n\\nMulti-Task Learning: For agents that require training data (e.g., RL agents, few-shot examples, etc.), following the JEROCH benchmark [7] for evaluating text game suites, we recommend training and evaluating across themes. Tasks 1 to 6 (i.e., theme Proteomics and Chemistry) can be used for training, tasks 7 through 12 (Archaeology and Reactor Lab) for development, and the remaining tasks 13 through 24 (Plant Nutrients, Space Sick, Rocket Science, and Translation) for testing. In addition, all tasks in the Unit Tests are available for training.\\n\\nCurriculum Learning: For agents that require training data of growing complexity, irrespective of the experimental setting, we recommend to simply follow the natural progression of the difficulty levels for each theme. In addition, all tasks in the Unit Tests are available for training.\\n\\nC.3 Discovery Themes\\n\\nThe following are descriptions of the 8 main discovery themes, and how these themes vary across each of the 3 levels of difficulty. Note: This section contains spoilers!\\n\\nProteomics This theme examines an agent\\u2019s ability to perform analyses that involve clustering and identifying outliers. The agent is told that a number of animal species exist in a remote habitat, with one hypothesized to have migrated from an isolated island in the distant past \\u2013 with the agent required to measure the abundance of different proteins (using a protein meter) to determine which species is the outlier. In normal difficulty the clustering problem is two dimensional (that is, values of two proteins are provided for each measured animal), while in challenge difficulty, the clustering problem is three dimensional. Protein concentrations are provided as values between zero and one. The protein concentration data is manufactured such that all animals protein values exist on the surface of a sphere centered on a randomly chosen point, with inliers having a small radius from the center (e.g. 0.1), and outliers having a much farther radius (e.g. 0.4). Inliers and outliers are clearly visible on a plot by inspection. The easy difficulty level reduces the number of animals from 5 to 3, and has the entire task take place in a small lab with unmoving animals, rather than a large map with moving animals.\\n\\nChemistry The chemistry theme evaluates an agents ability to explore a large solution space in the presence of a hill-climbing signal. Here, the agent is told they must manufacture a chemical (a rust removal agent), from some combination of unique chemicals available to them. The agent must enumerate the possible combinations of chemicals, prepare these solutions, and test them on a specific rusted object. After being immersed in a solution, the rusted object will decrease from heavily rusted to moderately or lightly rusted based on the cosine similarity between the chemical concentration of the solution that it is immersed in, and the correct solution, providing a hill-climbing signal for agents to use to more quickly explore the space of possible solutions. The normal difficulty has three possible chemical dispensers, the challenge has four chemical dispensers, and both require agents to find specific concentrations of chemicals (e.g. 1 part Chemical A, 2 parts Chemical B). The easy difficulty has four chemical dispensers, but requires no mixing \\u2013 one of the four chemicals is a direct solution.\\n\\nArchaeology The archaeology theme involves measuring (and validating) artifacts using radioisotope dating. In the challenge difficulty, the agent is presented with a dig site that contains six artifacts \\u2013 three known, three unknown \\u2013 as well as a radioisotope meter that measures 4 different radioisotopes. The agent is prompted that it is unknown if radioisotope dating works on Planet X, and if it does, which of the 4 radioisotopes will be useful for dating. The agent is tasked with finding the oldest unknown artifact, and placing a red flag beside its dig site. The known artifacts include one from the stone age (a stone hammer), one from the bronze age (a bronze chisel), and one from the iron age (iron tongs). The agent must know that in radioisotope dating, older artifacts have lower concentrations of a given radioisotope due to radioactive decay. The agent must also make the critical insight that stone age artifacts are older than bronze age artifacts, and iron age artifacts are younger than bronze\\nage artifacts. The data are manufactured such that one radioisotope follows this pattern, while others don\\u2019t (with a correlation of $R^2 < 0.1$ between age and radioisotope value for all incorrect channels). In the normal difficulty, the instrument directly supplies age, and evaluates instrument use rather than instrument validation. The easy difficulty is similar to normal but in a small lab environment.\\n\\n**Reactor Lab** The reactor lab theme requires agents to discover and use mathematical relationships between measured quantities using regression. The reactor lab contains a number of quantum crystals, each with a specific resonance frequency. The agent must place all crystals into specific slots, and tune each slot to that crystal\\u2019s frequency, for the reactor to activate. The frequency depends upon one of five measured properties \\u2013 density, temperature, radioactivity, crystal size, or crystal spectra \\u2013 which can be measured using instruments in the adjoining science lab. The agent is provided with some number of crystals with known frequencies, and two crystals with unknown frequencies. They must measure each crystal with each of the instruments, determine which physical property is related to the frequency (as well as how), and use this equation to calculate the frequencies of the unknown crystals. In the normal setting, 2 known crystals are provided, and the relationship can be found with linear regression ($y = mx + b$). In the challenge setting, 3 known crystals are provided, and the relationship is quadratic ($y = ax^2 + bx + c$). In the easy setting, only a single (correct) instrument is provided, there is only one unknown crystal, and the relationship requires only inferring the slope ($y = mx$).\\n\\n**Plant Nutrients** The plant nutrient theme requires agents to infer systems of rules based on observing both positive and negative examples. The agent finds itself at a botanical research center, and given the task of identifying the (unusual) nutrients that plants on PLANET X prefer. The research center includes a \\\"pilot field\\\" where 12 seeds have been planted, some of which sprouted correctly, as well as 3 \\u201ctest fields\\u201d, each controlled by a soil computer that allows manipulating the nutrients in its soil. The agent must infer the necessary levels of nutrients in the soil from the pilot field, then successfully grow at least two new plants by setting the nutrient levels in a test field to be appropriate, and planting (and growing) seeds in that field. All settings include five different nutrients. In the normal setting, rules are simple presence-at-value rules (i.e. plants require a specific nutrient, at a specific value of either low, medium, or high to grow), and these can be inferred from positive examples alone. In the challenge setting, the rules involve logical relations (e.g. XOR, AND, OR, NOT) between nutrients, and more examples are provided. The easy setting resembles normal except that nutrients are binary (present/absent) rather than varying in concentration.\\n\\n**Space Sick** The space sick theme requires agents to use open-ended discovery skills to investigate the cause of an illness. The agents are tasked with identifying why some colonists are becoming mildly ill when eating local food, and correcting this. The agent must discover that some food has been contaminated by mold, which can be directly observed with some instruments, and indirectly observed with others (e.g. through elevated spectrometer readings), or indirectly inferred (e.g. cooking food causes it to become safe). Distractors (such as some food being slightly radioactive) lead the agent down paths that do not solve the task. In the normal difficulty, the mold is directly observable using instrumentation. In the challenge difficulty, the agent must discover novel detection instrumentation. In the easy setting, the agent is placed in a lab with 3 samples of food and 4 instruments, and must identify which food sample is contaminated (which is detectable by only a single instrument).\\n\\n**It\\u2019s (not) Rocket Science!** The rocket science theme requires agents to measure quantities in an environment, then substitute these quantities into known equations to complete a task. Here, the agent is tasked with sending a rocket into a specific orbital height around PLANET X. In the challenge version of this task, the agent needs to enter to appropriate orbital velocity, as well as the type (and quantity) of propellant to be used. The agent is provided with a rocketry book containing all the formulas needed to complete the task. However, before it can calculate the required quantities, it needs to infer out how to measure unknown values such as PLANET X\\u2019s gravity and radius, as well as properties related to the three available types of propellant such as density, mass flow rate, and thrust when consumed by the rocket engine. This theme involves recalling known experiments performed on Earth and transposing them to PLANET X (e.g., Eratosthenes\\u2019 classical experiment to measure Earth\\u2019s radius[1]). The normal difficulty simplifies the task to requiring only orbital velocity (not propellant), while the easy difficulty tells the agent they are on a planet with a similar mass and radius.\\n\\n[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_Earth\\u2019s_circumference\\nto a known celestial body (e.g. Earth, Mars, Venus), eliminating the requirement to measure these values of PLANET X.\\n\\n**Lost in Translation**  The translation theme requires agents to infer the meanings of progressively more complicated utterances given access to an environment containing Rosetta-stone-style information. Here, the agent must translate an unknown language used by the native inhabitants of PLANET X. The agent first talks to one of the inhabitants, who speaks an utterance. From this, the agent must explore the village to gather clues about what each word means (e.g., visiting shops will help identifying the name of the items being sold there). In the *challenge* difficulty, instructions are composed of a verb, an amount, a color, and an item name (e.g., bring 3 red flowers). Bringing the correct number of the correct objects back to the inhabitant will complete the task. In the *normal* difficulty, the utterance requires translating only a single specific object. In the *easy* setting, the task is reduced to a small lab setting, where the agent must identify which item to bring to another agent based on its translation (accessible by a sign near the object).\\n\\n### C.4 Unit Tests\\n\\n![Figure 3](image.png) Example instances of the 10 Unit Test themes.\\n\\n#### C.4.1 Unit Test Environments\\n\\nThe unit tests are shown in Figure 3 and described in Table 8.\\n\\n### C.5 Object Properties\\n\\nA list of common object properties provided by the base OBJECT storage class is shown in Table 9.

The prompt contains information about the environment, how to interact with the environment, current environment state, teleportable locations, interactable objects, and valid actions. The previous steps are shown as a sequence of (thought, action, observation)s, e.g.:\\n\\n---\\n\\nHistory of action-observations:\\n\\nAction:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"action\\\": \\\"ROTATE_DIRECTION\\\",\\n  \\\"arg1\\\": \\\"north\\\",\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"I need to face north to approach the door and enter the building.\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nObservation:\\n```json\\n{\\\"message\\\": \\\"I rotated to face north.\\\", \\\"errors\\\": [], \\\"success\\\": true}\\n```\\n\\nAction:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"action\\\": \\\"OPEN\\\",\\n  \\\"arg1\\\": 2056,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"I need to open the door in front of me to enter the building.\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nObservation:\\n```json\\n{\\\"message\\\": \\\"I opened the door.\\\", \\\"errors\\\": [], \\\"success\\\": true}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe agent generates thoughts and actions using the JSON formatted output as shown above. Each action is executed in the environment and the returned observation is then added to the trajectory. Since tasks in DiscoveryWorld can be extremely long, the trajectories can often exceed the maximum token limit of our LLM. We generally hit the 8K token limit of GPT4-O in 40 steps. To avoid this, we limit the trajectory in the prompt to a maximum of 10K characters by removing the oldest (thought, action, observation)s and replacing it with the string [TRIMMED HISTORY].\\n\\nD.2 Plan-and-Execute\\n\\nAnother approach to deal with long trajectories used in prior work [34, 20] is to decompose the problem into a plan of simpler steps and executing each step independently using ReAct. Since it would be challenging to generate the entire plan in one shot without exploring the environment, we use iterative decomposition [11] where we generate one step of the plan, then execute it and based on the result generate the next step. The planner uses the same base LLM with the prompt describing the format of the plan, e.g.:\\n\\n---\\n\\nTask: Open the door and exit the building.\\n\\nPlan:\\nStep 1: Go to the door that leads to the exit\\n-- Task completed! I am at the door that leads to the exit\\n\\n21\\nStep 2: Open the door\\n   -- Task failed! Door is locked and I don't have the key\\nStep 3: Find the key to the door\\n...\\n\\nTo execute each step of the plan, we use the same ReAct agent as above but additionally add the previous steps of the plans and their results to the prompt. To prevent the ReAct agent from wasting time on infeasible steps, we add a hint to the prompt to consider returning the Task failed! message (e.g. Step 2 above) when 1/5th of the environment step budget is used up. We use the same truncation strategy for the ReAct agent and no truncation is needed for the planner due to the much shorter plans.\\n\\nD.3 Hypothesizer\\n\\nThis agent maintains a working memory of science-related knowledge (allowing the knowledge this agent has discovered to be more directly evaluated). To assist in planning and execution, this agent also maintains a running hypothesis for the task solution, as well as a short natural language plan for the immediate steps it should take. More specifically, at each step, HYPOTHEZIS chooses an action based on it\\u2019s current working memory, plan, and running hypothesis. It then reflects on the results of that action, and updates the working memory based on the results. The working memory is science themed, storing two types of records: (1) HYPOTHESES, which include the hypothesis statement, it\\u2019s current status (i.e. whether it has been confirmed, rejected, or is still pending), and a list of supporting evidence the agent has listed as helping make this determination, (2) and MEASUREMENTS, which take the form of specific observations the agent has made of objects in the environment \\u2013 for example, that a particular plant appeared to grow in a mixture including a specific nutrient. This memory and reflection is similar to CLIN [18], except: (a) this memory is structured to hold science-domain relations, where CLIN\\u2019s holds causal relations, and (b) this memory is updated after each action in the environment, where CLIN\\u2019s is updated only after running an entire task to completion. This means that, if an agent takes N steps in an environment, it requires 2N LLM calls to accommodate this act-then-reflect cycle. Because the memory can grow large, after every 10 actions, the working memory is summarized through a separate LLM call that requests a maximum of 40 separate hypothesis or measurement entries, and a maximum of 2k tokens for the entire memory. When producing actions, HYPOTHEZIS is prompted to produce (1) a specific action, (2) an explanation that includes its running hypothesis, and how this action helps move it towards evaluating this hypothesis, and (3) a short memory describing its plans or any other helpful information it wishes to pass on to the next step. When prompted to produce actions, HYPOTHEZIS is provided with (a) the current observation from the environment, (b) the last 3 actions it took (and their respective explanations and notes), (c) it\\u2019s current working memory, (d) a list of possible actions and which arguments they take. All output is produced as a JSON dictionary.\\n\\nThe working memory that Hypothesizer stores can be long, especially for longer tasks. An example of the Hypothesizer agent\\u2019s working memory at the successful completion of a specific shorter task (Proteomics, Normal, Seed 2) is provided below.\\n\\n```\\nTask Description: You are in a biological preserve on Planet X, that has 5 different animal species. We suspect that one of these animal species is not native to the area, but migrated from an isolated island in the recent past. Your task is to use the proteomics meter to analyze the proteins of each of the 5 animal species, which can be found throughout the environment away from the central statue area, and determine which species is the anomaly. Once you have completed your task, return to the statue area and drop the red flag directly beside the statue of the animal species that is the anomaly.\\n\\n\\\"working_memory\\\": {\\n   \\\"scientific_knowledge\\\": [\\n   {\\n      \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The spheroid (uuid: 23195) is located in Possible Animal Area 1.\\\",\\n      \\\"step\\\": 2\\n   },\\n   {\\n      \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The proteomics meter (uuid: 33276) is now in my inventory.\\\",\\n      \\\"step\\\": 8\\n   },\\n   {\\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The proteomics meter (uuid: 33276) is now in my inventory.\\\",\\n      \\\"step\\\": 8\\n   },\\n   {\\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The proteomics meter (uuid: 33276) is now in my inventory.\\\",\\n      \\\"step\\\": 8\\n   }\\n   ]\\n\\n```\\n\\n22\\n\\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The proteomics meter (uuid: 33276) requires two argument objects to be used.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 10\\n},\\n{ \\\"hypothesis\\\": \\\"if (object:spheroid) is (action:directly in front) then (object:proteomics meter) can be used to analyze its proteins.\\\",\\n\\\"status\\\": \\\"confirmed\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 13,\\n\\\"supporting evidence\\\": \\\"Using the proteomics meter on the spheroid yielded protein data: Protein A: 0.87, Protein B: 0.80.\\\"\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The spheroid (uuid: 23195) has Protein A level of 0.87 and Protein B level of 0.80 when analyzed using the proteomics meter.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 13\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The animaplant (uuid: 20030) is located in Possible Animal Area 2.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 14\\n},\\n{ \\\"hypothesis\\\": \\\"if (object:animaplant) is (action:analyzed) using (object:proteomics meter) then (property:protein data) will be obtained.\\\",\\n\\\"status\\\": \\\"confirmed\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 15,\\n\\\"supporting evidence\\\": \\\"Using the proteomics meter on the animaplant yielded protein data: Protein A: 0.76, Protein B: 0.67.\\\"\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The animaplant (uuid: 20030) has Protein A level of 0.76 and Protein B level of 0.67 when analyzed using the proteomics meter.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 15\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The animal in Possible Animal Area 3 (uuid: 20031) is not accessible.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 17\\n},\\n{ \\\"hypothesis\\\": \\\"if (object:animal) is (action:teleported to) using (object:uuid: 20031) then (property:accessibility) will be false.\\\",\\n\\\"status\\\": \\\"confirmed\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 22,\\n\\\"supporting evidence\\\": \\\"Attempting to teleport to the animal object with UUID 20031 resulted in an error indicating that no object with that UUID was found.\\\"\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"There is a tree (big) trunk blocking the path to the west.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 25\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"I successfully moved south to navigate around the tree (big) trunk.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 26\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"I successfully moved west to get directly in front of the pink animal.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 28\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"I rotated to face west, aligning myself with the pink animal.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 30\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The object directly in front of me, which I thought was a pink animal, is actually grass (uuid: 20981).\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 31\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The proteomics meter (uuid: 33276) was used to investigate the grass (uuid: 20981), but the results were inconclusive.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 31\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The object with UUID 44261 is a plant, not an animal.\\\",\\n\\\"step\\\": 37\\n},\\n{ \\\"measurement\\\": \\\"The proteomics meter (uuid: 33276) was used to investigate the animaplant (uuid: 44261).

Scientists were recruited on the UpWork platform, each with: (1) an MSC or PhD in a natural science, (2) self-evaluated comfort and fluency with statistical methods and common software like spreadsheets, (3) comfort and previous experience with 2D top-down games. To evaluate the latter, all participants were required to complete a screening task involving a Tutorial in DISCOVERYWORLD. Participants were given a maximum of one hour to complete each task. While our agent models are run in a zero-shot setting, humans can\\u2019t forget their past experiences, so our participants only completed the normal and challenge settings, to prevent any easily-discovered knowledge in the easy setting from providing an advantage in other settings. To collect accurate estimates of task difficulty, all humans completed the same seed (S EED 0) of each task. To evaluate discovered knowledge, participants were asked to keep notes, and explicitly state their hypotheses, and supporting evidence. Due to the varied nature of these notes (some wrote a few words, others entire pages per task) and their modality (text, spreadsheets), discovery knowledge was evaluated manually using the following criteria: 1 (discovered all discovery knowledge in scorecard), 0.5 (discovered some discovery knowledge in scorecard), or 0 (did not find critical discovery knowledge). Other metrics (task completion, procedural knowledge) were evaluated automatically. At their option, not all participants completed all tasks.\\n\\nInformed Consent  Details about the project\\u2019s objective and the intended use of data generated during game play was provided to participants in the initial job description. Participants were further provided with a participation agreement detailing that all data generated from the project will be owned by AI2, which they agreed to by choosing to participate in the project.\\n\\nParticipant Instructions  Participant instructions can be found in README-USERSTUDY.MD on the DISCOVERYWORLD code repository.\\n\\nPotential Participant Risks  To protect the personal information and anonymity of the human scientists we recruited, no personally identifying information was collected and all data is anonymized.\\n\\nRecruitment  Participants were recruited and hired on Upwork, where they were initially required to submit a proposal detailing their educational background, experience with statistical analyses and Python programming, and interest in video games.\\n\\nCompensation  Human scientists were compensated at a rate ranging from USDS20-$30/hr for their work, based on the rate they bid in their initial job proposals. The total amount spent on participant compensation did not exceed $4,000.\\n\\nParticipants\\u2019 Expertise  The participants we recruited had Master\\u2019s or Doctorate degrees in a range of disciplines. Their educational and/or work experience spanned the following fields: astrophysics, bioinformatics, biology, biomedical engineering, biostatistics, chemistry, computer engineering, data science, electrical engineering, geology, machine learning, mathematics, and physics.\\n\\nGraphical Interface  Humans made use of the 2D graphical user interface for their study, rather than a text-only version (as some agent models use). Figure 4 shows an example of the interface.\\n\\nTime limit  Human participants were given a maximum of 1 hour to complete a given task.\\nZero-shot Performance While participants were allowed to retry tasks that they did not complete successfully the first time, we did not include any retries in our evaluation of human performance, to give an accurate analog of zero-shot model performance.\\n\\nData Instructions on how to get the anonymized data from human participants is available at https://github.com/allenai/discoveryworld.\\n\\nSave failures DISCOVERYWORLD automatically saves log files to evaluate performance. Some participants noted infrequent issues with this automatic save on the WINDOWS platform that we were unable to resolve.

As a result, it is challenging to conduct and advance scientific research on language modeling, such as understanding how training data impacts model capabilities and limitations. To facilitate scientific research on language model pretraining, we curate and release Dolma, a three-trillion-token English corpus, built from a diverse mixture of web content, scientific papers, code, public-domain books, social media, and encyclopedic materials. We extensively document Dolma, including its design principles, details about its construction, and a summary of its contents. We present analyses and experimental results on intermediate states of Dolma to share what we have learned about important data curation practices. Finally, we open-source our data curation toolkit to enable reproduction of our work as well as support further research in large-scale data curation. 1\\n\\n1This manuscript was prepared for Dolma v. 1.6. As our work on open data for language modeling continues, we will continue to improve Dolma. Updated versions can be found in the provided links.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nLanguage models are now central to tackling myriad natural language processing tasks, including few-shot learning, summarization, question answering, and more. Increasingly, the most powerful language models are built by a few organizations who withhold most model development details (Anthropic, 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Anil et al., 2023; Gemini Team et al., 2023). In particular, the composition of language model pretraining data is often vaguely described, even in cases where the model itself is released for public use, such as Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b). This hinders understanding of the effects of pretraining corpus composition on model capabilities and limitations, with impacts on scientific progress as well as on the public who interfaces with these models.

An organisation's policy and procedures usually stipulate how promotions should be conducted and various roles to be played by those who have the responsibility to commence and finalise promotional processes. The important aspect of the processes is to make sure that there is fairness throughout the processes. Fairness in this sense connotes that the laid down policy and procedures for promotion must be followed and applied by giving all applicants fair and equal opportunities. The perceptions of the applicants become more important and crucial where it is discovered that there was unfair labour practice inherent in the processes that led to advancement. Against this backdrop, fairness or lack of has serious implications on the concept of fair labour practice and the outcome of the selection processes. Consequently, if promotion is perceived by an applicant as unfair, it might trigger agitation, which in turn may lead to quest for redress before the relevant adjudicating authority. Against the backdrop of this problem, this paper seeks to examine applicants' perception of the fairness of promotion processes and the consequences of unfairness in selection, promotion and advancement\\n\\nKeywords: Promotions, Employees, Perceptions, Fairness, Selection Processes, Unfair Labour Practices\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nThe issue of promotion is very sensitive in any organisation and, as such, it is expected that it should be treated with the high standard of professionalism by those who have the responsibility to either confer or not-to-confer promotion unto a candidate. Promotion or advancement would have taken place if an employee advances or progresses to a higher position in an organisation (Garbers, 2001). However, in most cases, employees are regularly evaluated through internal processes by their superiors or assessors before any advancement or progression could transpire. Alternatively, such could also be informed by responding to an advertisement (Grogan, 2009). In that case, if the current employee is found appointable and got the job, promotion would thus have also occurred. Pursuant to this, there are various reasons that may motivate for either a promotion of an employee or not (Meyer, 2004). It could be as a result of the commitment of the employee, leading to attainment of set goals; if it is internal workplace promotions whereby there would not be any need to advertise in order to solicit applications from those who would meet the requirements.\\n\\nWith regard to applicants applying externally, the promotion exercise may not be too problematic. However, with regard to internal promotion, this may be problematic for various reasons. An internal applicant for promotion is already an employee of the company and must have been involved in various issues that would probably impact on whether he should be promoted or not. Being an insider, the applicant is already contaminated in one way or another. If there is more than one applicant vying for a single position in the organisation, the race and competition become more tedious and sometimes full of suspicions. In most cases, whoever succeeds in being promoted may face a lot of challenges at the end of the day from those who were not promoted.\\n\\nTherefore, the task of those administering promotion is thus to see and ensure that there is fairness and justice in the exercises. However, the issue of fairness is also subjective. What is considered fair to one person might be perceived as unfair by the other. The issue of fairness is very significant at the workplace. An aggrieved person who ought to be promoted but denied will not only consider the procedure and the processes unfair, but can only take further steps by approaching an appropriate court to seek redress and damages.\\n2. Objective\\n\\nA lot of issues usually arise regarding promotion in the workplace, especially if it is perceived that there have been unfair practices during the promotion process or procedure. Undoubtedly, this will definitely affect the employee who is aggrieved with the process and may also impact the workplace environment by making people to be disgruntled and not want to put in their best because of the perception that, when it comes to upliftment, the employer might act unfairly. Therefore, the key objectives of this paper are to consider when promotion will be regarded as either fair or unfair and the reaction of the parties involved. If it is unfair, what are the appropriate steps and remedies that can be explored by an aggrieved employee to ensure that fair labour practice is restored in order to protect the right to fair labour practices.\\n\\n3. Problem Statement\\n\\nIn the workplace, promotion that is done outside of the principles of fairness is destructive and invites unnecessary and unwarranted litigations. Although, several court cases have proven that both substantive and procedural fairness are key in the promotion of employees in a workplace, some of the employers are seen to be reluctant in taking these pivotal principles of fairness very seriously, thereby continuing to incur litigious costs that are unwarranted. Although it is trite law that the employers are not bound to promote their employees to higher positions, however, when such situations arise, they are bound to act fairly and within the boundaries of the LRA.\\n\\n4. Methodology\\n\\nThe methodology for this study was reliance on the literature relevant to how an applicant, who had been unfairly treated during promotional exercises, perceived the overall procedures from the beginning to the end. As part of the argument to justify whether a promotional exercise was fair to us, the study accentuates on the need to follow the laid-down procedure and policy of the company or establishment seeking to hire or promote employees. This position is supported by laws and regulations of many countries, including South Africa. The study also presents consequences for non-compliance with the laid-down procedure and policy, and submits vehemently that failure to comply will vitiate the selection processes and the aggrieved party can approach an appropriate court to seek redress, and appropriate remedies and reliefs may be granted and ordered. However, the study indicates that the decision to appoint is incumbent upon the employer, provided the laid-down procedure and policy have been followed. Therefore, what an employer needs to do is to apply its mind and appoint a suitable person for the job, not necessarily the best or the person who scored the highest mark.\\n\\n5. Literature Review\\n\\nAt common law, the issue of promotion is not contestable unless it is enshrined in the contract of employment detailing criteria for promotion. Against this backdrop, an employee has no legal right or entitlement to insist on promotion to the next or any higher post, except if the contract of employment explicitly spelt out the conditions regulating promotions in the contract of employment (Shapiro and Tune 1974). It is in this regard that an employee could make a claim in terms of those conditions. Therefore, if an employer refuses to apply its mind by promoting an employee, the employee has no legal right to institute an action against the employer and claim that the employer acted unfairly (Van Jaarsveld, 2008). For this and other reasons, this is why the State has to intervene by enacting laws to protect the rights of employees against unfair labour practices (Peck, 1979).\\n\\nPursuant to this, if the contract does not stipulate promotional issues, an employee cannot institute an action in court to compel it (Estreicher, 1997). Even if an action is instituted, the defendant may raise the issue of jurisdiction and submit that the court has no jurisdiction to entertain or hear such case (Carrington and Haagen 1996). In South Africa, the Labour Relations Act has come to rectify this anomaly, therefore promotions are recognised under the law (Bhorat et al. 2002). An employee who is entitled to or denied promotion by any means by the employer can approach the court and the CCMA and sue for unfair labour practice (Bhorat and Van der Westhuizen 2009). When the legislature enacted the LRA into law, the purport is to regulate all conditions of employment in a workplace and draw the lines where necessary. Workers have rights even though the employer is the owner of the business. Consequently, both employer and employee\\u2019s acts are regulated by the LRA and by the Constitution of the Land. With regard to the issues of unfair labour practice in promotional exercises, an employer will be considered to have contravened Section 186(2)(a) of the LRA and would be found civilly liable for unfair labour practices pertaining to any form of unfair conducts relating to the promotion, advancement, elevation, demotion, probation or training of an employee (Okpaluba, 1999).\\nIt is important to mention that it is the prerogative of an employer to either hire or not any person to a vacant post whether it is a promotion or not (Stevens, 1996). An employer can also decide to create or freeze a vacant post or refuse to appoint a new person (Gould, 2009). What is legally important is that, whenever an employer decides to recruit, the law will set in, hence the employer must ensure that the process is fair and objective in order not for the selection process to end up being litigated; as this sometimes could be a set back to the day to day running of the business of the employer (Verkerke, 1998). Litigation will consume money and time, and will probably leave the post to be filled vacant for years until the court finally makes a judicial decision (Epstein, 1998). The employer must ensure that, procedurally, there is full compliance with the provisions of the law in order for the process not to be declared as unfair labour practice (Furlong, 1984). Consequent upon this, an employer is not compelled to promote or to hire to fill a post, but if this has to be done, then good faith, fairness and objectivity should be apparent and displayed in all the processes (Weston, 2001).\\n\\nExcept the employer acted unfairly during promotional exercises, an employee cannot insist that he should be promoted to a higher post (Cooper and Sobol 1969). However, if the employee can show that the employer\\u2019s act during the processes was unfair and the selection was unfair and biased, which thus prejudiced his being promoted, then and then, the employer can raise the issue of unfair labour practice (Arvey, 1979). It is only with regard of this that an employee can raise unfair labour practice, otherwise if the employer\\u2019s act is in line with company policy and procedure, and conforms with the LRA and the Constitution, the employee will not sustain the issue of unfair labour practice, if raised.\\n\\nThe issue of fairness with regard to promotion should be based on an objective test (Crawshaw, 2006). It is what any reasonable person can see and should be able to take a stand on whether it is fair or not. By evaluating the decision, process, procedure and all ancillary issues related to the decision, one should be able to see whether the decision taken is fair or not. A study by Truxillo et al., (2004) dealt extensively with the question of when fairness should matter in selection procedures. They also examined the usefulness of the organizational justice approach to applicant reactions and organisational outcomes. These are necessary in view of the fact that whoever is selected will impact the person\\u2019s career and also advance the key business of the organisation in terms of performance and efficiency.\\n\\nSimilarly, the issue of perception of fairness and in particular, procedural fairness has shown that this impact on the psychological experiences and behaviours of employees shown to affect a wide assortment of people\\u2019s psychological experiences and behaviours (Brockner et al. 2008). When the selection procedure used was fair, people perceived it as credible and therefore reacted positively to the outcome of the selection processes. In case of malicious grievance against such decision, people will react by supporting the company on the basis that the processes were transparent and devoid of suppression of views. In most cases, if the processes were challenged for one reason or another, the employer will likely get the support of other employees to provide credible evidence in case of any dispute (Brockner et al. 2008).\\n\\nThe study conducted by Harel et al., (2003) revealed that fairness in promotion could be a motivating factor for high performance to an applicant who was selected during the promotion. It enhances confidence and self-esteem, and confirms that, through healthy competition, the person selected deserved to be selected to the position because he met all the requirements of the selection processes.\\n\\nThe study conducted by Adebayo (2005) showed that when fairness is observed in a workplace by the leadership, employees are motivated by this, and where it is the contrary, employees are least motivated. Applying this finding, if promotion is based on fairness to all concerns and the procedures are diligently followed, no matter the outcome, the other employees would be satisfied and be motivated to work harder with the hope that when such an opportunity arises, if they apply, they stand the chance of being selected. If the processes are not fair, they become a source of disincentive and can lead to disillusionment and complacency whereby employees might start thinking that no matter how hard working or qualified for the job one is, if the opportunity arises, one may not get it.\\n\\nAccording to Garc\\u00eda-Izquierdo et al. (2012:394), fairness in promotions is a core issue for organizations as it is directly related to some of the most important organizational outcomes\\u201d. Garc\\u00eda-Izquierdo et al., (2012:394) accentuate that workers\\u2019 perceptions of promotion systems have impact on the organizational justice and job satisfaction. If the promotion methods are perceived to be transparent, they will consider this as procedural justice and that the method is fairer based on assessment of performance. In this sense, transparency is considered as an important antecedent of Procedural Justice. In all respect, procedural fairness will always result to job satisfaction (Garc\\u00eda-Izquierdo et al. 2012).\\n\\nElkins et al.\\u2019s (2003) study dwelled on the issues of gender and affirmative actions in the workplace. Their study revealed that in in an affirmative action environment, the promotion of a female usually resulted into positive or negative perceptions. The follow up is usually a lot of insinuations and guess work irrespective of whether the female has really proved herself, this is common in a workplace. Bald and McBrier (1997) examined promotion tied to race, especially the Black and White phenomenon in the USA. They pointed out that, if promotion is race blind, there is a tendency that Blacks or Whites with required qualification can get the job. In the final analysis, their study revealed that that the\\ndeterminants of promotion systematically differ for Blacks and Whites. Whites are always getting promoted in the workplace over Blacks, even where Blacks are doing the same job. In South Africa, these days, the reverse is the case. In view of the numerous policies promoting Black empowerment and affirmative actions, Blacks, especially females, are always treated favourably regarding promotions at the workplace (BaldandMcBrier, 1997).\\n\\nJanssen\\u2019s (2000) study demonstrated that employee who is creative and productive should be rewarded and those that are not should not be. If hard work is rewarded, employee will perceive this as an effort-reward fairness rather than under-reward unfairness. Pursuant to this, if a hardworking employee is denied promotion, it will amount to under-reward unfairness.\\n\\n6. A Consideration of Issues Surrounding Fairness\\n\\nIn the workplace, it is not surprising to hear employees complain of fairness or unfairness of activities going on whether with regard to workload, disciplinary issues, promotional and so on, working conditions, salary, discrimination, company\\u2019s policy, promotions and demotions and so on (Harris et al. 2000). The conclusion to be drawn from these issues is the concerned about fairness or the lack of, followed by the consequences and expectations for violation. This is why, in an organisation, selection context is replete with examples of situations where there are suspicious, favourisms, discriminations on numerous grounds and so on. In most cases, a person is refused a job based on these situations while in another in another; a person is favoured and offered a job. These situations usually trigger action and reactions by the aggrieved person who was not offered the job. At this stage, the aggrieved person, together with those who believed there was unfairness in the processes, will consider the outcome not credible. As long as the right thing is not done, such appointments will always generate controversy (ArveyandRenz, 1992).\\n\\nFairness issues can also be used in consideration of dispute resolution (Delgado et al. 1985). This usually happen during adjudication processes. The presiding or the adjudicating authority would want to ensure that the outcome is fair to all concerns. In promotion cases, fairness issues also appear prominently. Considering that this relates to labour issues, it is tested from the enabling law regarding any labour issue being considered. Therefore, because of its unique position, fairness appears prominently in the Constitution and the Labour Relations Act. The panellists to adjudicate promotion are therefore expected to be fair. This is a statutory requirement under numerous laws. Being fair is following the laid-down rules, procedures and policy guiding and regulating the process. By following this step, it will make the process credible and reduce the possibility of consternation of the outcome of the process.\\n\\nHowever, if a member is biased and decides to be part of the processes throughout, this issue may be raised by the affected employee at the appropriate time. Usually, during redress, where the process will be subjected to scrutiny and review, this and other challenges need to be properly taken care of in order to have and present an acceptable outcome which will be perceived to be fair procedurally and substantially. The prejudiced panellist may get away with his act if no one contests the outcome of the selection process. Legally, this is proper. However, if it was discovered that the member was biased against any of the candidates, moral conscience will definitely judge such a member. Apart from the issue of conscience, the member would be perceived to have directly or indirectly compromised the section through his or action as this will lead to the appointment of less qualified person. The result of this is not far-fetched, the appointed person might not be able to perform and deliver based on the requirements of the job. Undoubtedly, this will definitely impact the company or establishment. This has always been the case with regard to cadre deployment under the policy of the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa. Unqualified people are always selected to do jobs that require skills and expertise. On assumption of office after appointed, they become disservice and render poor performances and services to the people. Persistent violent service delivery protests across the country bear witness to the appalling level of poor service delivery by deployees.\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of ensuring procedural justice and fairness in selection processes, there are important principles that have been developed overtime and considered as basic and vital elements, which are used as yardsticks to assess whether there has been procedural justice and fairness in selection procedures. The principles are as follows: Objectivity, wherein the processes of selections should be open, fair, equitable and objective up to the conclusion reached; Consistence, this is expected to apply across the applicants. All applicants for the job must be treated equally and fairly. The rules must be consistent and not deviated from. Discrimination on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, colour and religion should be discouraged. All applicants should be subjected to almost similar questions during interviews and time allocated should also be consistent throughout. The process should not be subject to manipulation where an applicant will stand in a vantage position against others. All applicants are expected to be assessed based on a common set of criteria and standard. Political ties and external meddling would be unfair and unjust. Examples of how political interference plays a major role in appointments in the public sectors abound in South\\nAfrica. Cadre deployments have taken over real and formal selection processes. At the end of the day, unqualified and untested cadres will be appointed. Professionals should be in charge of selection processes and not mediocre.\\n\\nProfessionalism strengthens the processes because the people selecting are considered knowledgeable and can make good decisions that will assist the process. Confidentiality is very important. The confidentiality of the procedures must be maintained. The information of the process should not be released so also the identities of the applicants scores, tests items and the one that was adjudged the best during the interviews. Release of information should always be through official sources; otherwise the process will be discredited and weakened. Most importantly, the panel must be diversified and consist of different persons with different perspectives and constituencies. For instance, if the selection for advancement is at a university or an academic setting, it is important to have different persons constituting the interview panel, from the academia, labour unions, students\\u2019 representatives and the human resources. These people, representing different constituencies with the university community, will ask questions, based on their backgrounds, to the applicants based on the procedures and policy. Thereafter, collectively, the panellists will apply their minds and select the most suitable or appointable candidate for the job (Arvey and Renz, 1992).\\n\\n7. Promotions are Prerogative of Employers but Must be Substantive and Procedurally Fair\\n\\nEven though an employer has the right to either promote or not, whatever decision is taken, it must be procedurally and substantively fair otherwise the process will be nullified and declared invalid. This is applicable in both private and public sectors. Failure to follow due processes will usually attract unpleasant consequences. Hence, it is imperative for an employer to get it right and not blunder. Consequently, at all times, it is incumbent upon the employer to have reasonable and convincing reasons for promoting an employee. In case an aggrieved applicant challenges the decision and becomes successful, the employer will be guilty of unfair labour practice. To avoid this type of scenario, the employer should ensure that the decision to promote is based on well-founded and correct principles and reasons by demonstrating convincingly that the applicant that is promoted is well suitable for the position. As Du plessis (2002) puts it, there must be a logical connection between the real reason and the decision taken (Du plessis, 2002). But this issue of substance and being objective might be dicey sometimes. It poses a lot of challenges to the employer because the decision to prefer one applicant over another is always problematic in the workplace. An employer needs to balance all interests, apply its mind to ensure that there is no favouritism, that, all things being equal, all parties are given fair hearing, and that there is no element of bias prior, during and after selection processes.\\n\\nHowever, it is necessary to point out that even if an employer would have followed and complied with due processes diligently, this employer has the discretionary right not to employ the best suitable person. The employer reserves the right to choose whoever it considers to be the best candidate and this will always be upheld, unless there is discovery of elements of mala fide or that the promotion was done arbitrarily.\\n\\nThe employer may set some acceptable standard for considerations of promotional processes. This will assist in scrutinising the decision to be taken before final promotion is made. The employer may set a certain hierarchy to the stated requirements. But during interviews, the employer may not ask questions on all the standard set. Most importantly, this will not render the process invalid because it is just a guide that may be used as standard to ask questions. The employer can also deviate from the marks scored. If the person who scored the highest marks during the interview is not appointed, this will not jeopardise the appointment of the person who might have scored lower marks but was found appointable. Provided the employer followed its policy on ratings and duly applied its mind during the selection process, the decision to hire or promote person with a lower marks will not be fatal to the processes. This is the general practice in South Africa. The fact that a particular candidate obtained more marks in the interview is immaterial when it comes to the issue of appointment of a successful candidate; the panellists will appoint by applying their minds, not by virtue of marks scored by the candidates. The panellists therefore have the right to deviate from the marks scored and only apply their minds and appoint the best suitable candidate for the job. One important point that needs emphasise always is to admonish employers or their managers and superiors not to promise any contending candidate for a job or promotion; that come rain or sunshine, the applicant will be hired or promoted. In some cases, the panel needs to recommend to a higher body before promotion can be approved, that is, if the practice is that, whenever a recommendation to the highest body is made, there will be promotion. However, it is important to mention that there could be deviation from this practice. If the applicant recommended is not appointed by the higher body, it will not be fatal to the process. What needs to be established is whether the higher body has applied its mind. If this is proven to be correct and confirmed, that will not be unfair labour practice.\\n\\nThe issue of affirmative action and denial of promotion to some of the employees who fall within a designated group is very problematic and challenging. Sometimes, employers use this to deny some employees promotions just...\\nvarious statutory remedies available to a victim of unfair labour practice (Peck, 1970). The adjudicating institutions can\\nAn aggrieved applicant has the right to approach an appropriate adjudicating institution to seek redress by exploring\\n9. Remedies for Denial of Promotion as a Result of Unfair Labour Practice\\n\\nPromotion is usually contested when it is advertised internally and sometimes externally where an employee seems to be\\nunder the impression that, because of acting on a position for years, the job should normally be given to him or her. To the internal employee, this will serve as an upliftment. However, if anything is done contrary to this, the employee might look at it as injustice and unfair. Consequently, an aggrieved employee might take appropriate steps by instituting an action in court to contest the decision of the panel not to appoint him to the higher position (Sims, 1976).\\n\\nThere are various implications for these and sometimes there are consequences. But the goal of the employer is to hire the best person who can do the job and enhance the performance of the organisation. According to Giolland and Steiner (2001:175), \\\"we need to hire the best and brightest. The best and brightest are usually in high demand at other companies, so we have to make sure we create our applicants well. That is part of our competitive advantage\\\". Giolland and Steiner (2001:175-176) continue thus: \\u201cwe want to do everything we can to make sure that each experience an employee has with our company is a positive one. This starts with interview process because first impression often extends through an employee\\u2019s entire stay with the company\\\".\\n\\nTherefore, an applicant\\u2019s perception is considered important because such affects an applicant\\u2019s job and how he performs upon assumption of duty. There are also different consequences for this. Giolland and Steiner (2001:175-176) point out that \\u201cour applicants are also potential customers. When we interview applicants we are not only in an assessment mode, but also in a selling mode. We strive to create a comfortable, hassle-free experience for our applicant\\u201d.\\n\\nAlso important is the issue of fairness in procedure and practices during the process. If the applicant perceives that these were not followed as stipulated, it will impact on justice. This is because organisational justice entails procedure and concerns of distributive justice. Hence the concepts of fairness and justice are closely linked. As such, issues relating to perceived fairness or justice, terms which are used interchangeably by researchers, are entrenched in the workplace.\\n\\n8. Causes and Consequences of Applicant\\u2019s Perceptions of Unfairness\\n\\nAn aggrieved applicant has the right to approach an appropriate adjudicating institution to seek redress by exploring various statutory remedies available to a victim of unfair labour practice (Peck, 1970). The adjudicating institutions can grant several remedial orders in favour of the unfairly treated employee regarding unfairness in promotional exercises (Kok, 2008).\\n\\nAdjudicating institutions, mostly the law courts, have fashioned a range of remedies such as a declaratory order, remittal to an employer for consideration, protective promotion, actual promotion, and compensation (Rendleman, 1974).\\n\\nIf there was a predetermined intention to appoint a certain applicant by an employer and the employer so did, but in the course of selection process the employer fails to follow its own procedure (Catiz, 1981), this conduct might have potentially prejudiced other applicants. If this is the case, the court has the inherent power to make a declaratory order (Jaffe, 1962).\\n\\nAnother challenging situation is when an employer might have filled the post by itself without giving others who applied to be interviewed a chance (Fowler and Mangione 1990). In this situation, there could be a remedial action of insisting that those other applicants who were not interviewed now be interviewed (Cooper and Sobol 1969). But the issue is that, if the results are out and negative in that the applicants were not appointed, the issue of unfair labour practice will be raised on the ground that the subsequent interviews conducted were tainted by bad faith on the part of the panellists (Cooper and Sobol 1969). However, it will not be appropriate to appoint an unfit applicant. The applicant can only be successful if there is cogent evidence to contradict an earlier appointment made. The problem inherent in this situation is that the applicants who were not selected or given opportunities to be interviewed at the same time when the first selections were made will continue to perceive the processes as being unfair and unjust.\\nThere could also be a protective promotion. This is a situation where an employee is not promoted to the actual post, but is promoted in rank and remuneration (Byrt, 1966). This remedy is usually used to protect those who are vulnerable to or disadvantaged by a certain policy reason. The court will always come to the aid of the applicant in this situation and protect any promotion that is due by ensuring that the applicant is promoted.\\n\\nThe court can also impose actual promotion. This situation will arise where the aggrieved applicant is contesting the advertised post in the court and during the processes of litigation until it is finalised, if the position has not been filled, the court can, on its own impose actual promotion by giving the position to the aggrieved party (Chayes et al. 1970). This will be a confirmation of getting what the applicant really merited and deserved.\\n\\nCompensation as a remedy will be availed to an aggrieved employee where, due to procedural irregularity, the applicant\\u2019s application was not processed for promotion. The selection process will amount to be procedurally unfair in all respects and constitute unfair labour practice. Consequently, failure to present an employee\\u2019s application before the relevant decision maker constitutes a serious procedural irregularity for which compensation is justified (Boynton, 1986).\\n\\n10. Conclusion\\n\\nPromotion and advancement in a workplace are very important and serve as incentives for reward of hard work and the need for employees to continue on the path of giving the best to an organisation. But such can also be a very sensitive issue if not handled well. The perception of employees toward promotion can either increase the productivity of a company or decrease it; and sometimes it might even destroy and liquidate the organisation in its entirety. This is why it is important for an employer to be sensitive and ensure that it follows and applies the laid-down policy and procedure during the processes of promotional exercises. Anything done contrary to this will be regarded as unfair labour practice and will attract consequences. However, the mere fact that a preferred candidate for promotion was not appointed does not warrant the process to be declared invalid. What is important is that the employer has applied its mind and followed the procedure and appointed the best suitable candidate. However, if there is failure on the part of the employer to do this, the aggrieved applicant has various remedies under the law that could be explored to redress the unfairness.\\n\\n11. Recommendations\\n\\nAdvancement and promotion can make or mar an applicant, especially when the people who are given the responsibility to promote treat the issues of promotion and advancement with levy and disdain. Knowing fully well that career upliftment is self-fulfilling and can unlock other opportunities, however, if panellists fail to apply their minds, this might negatively impact the career of another person and thus lead to shattered dreams and ambition. While there are remedies available to an aggrieved applicant, this should be explored and an adjudicating body should impose punitive sanction for unfair labour practice. It is also highly recommended that if, prior, during and after selection processes, it is found that a member or panellist acted mala fide - that is, with bad faith and arbitrarily - action should not only be instituted against the employer, but the civil responsibility of any panellist or the entire panellists should also be explored in order to make them accountable for their unfair labour practices.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAdebayo DO2005.

RNA structural motif recognition aims to find RNA substructures that are similar to a query motif, and it is important for RNA structure analysis and RNA function prediction. In view of this, we propose a new method known as RNA Structural Motif Recognition based on Least-Squares distance (LS-RSMR) to effectively recognize RNA structural motifs. A test set consisting of five types of RNA structural motifs occurring in Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA is compiled by us. Experiments are conducted for recognizing these five types of motifs. The experimental results fully reveal the superiority of the proposed LS-RSMR compared with four other state-of-the-art methods.\\n\\nKeywords: RNA structural motif; RNA motif recognition\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nLong noncoding RNA (ncRNA), which consists of >200 nt and has little or no protein-coding capability, is a remarkable class of RNAs. They are important in various biological processes (Dinger et al. 2008; Guttman et al. 2009, 2011; Mattick et al. 2009; Pang et al. 2009). In their tertiary structures, some of the nucleotides will form special substructures, which have consensus structural patterns and occur repetitively in RNA molecules. These substructures are called RNA structural motifs. They are building blocks of different RNA architectures and play an important role in binding proteins and consolidating RNA tertiary structures (Moore 1999; Leontis et al. 2002; Fran\\u00e7ois et al. 2005; Hendrix et al. 2005; Leontis et al. 2006).\\n\\nMany types of RNA structural motifs have been identified: tetraloop (Woese et al. 1990), sarcin/ricin loop (Szewczak et al. 1993), \\u03c0-turn (Klein et al. 2001), kink-turn (Wadley and Pyle 2004), and C-loop (Leontis and Westhof 2003), to name a few. Recently, several new types of motifs have been identified: G-ribo (Steinberg and Boutorine 2007), UA_handle (Jaeger et al. 2008), and A-wedge (Gagnon and Steinberg 2010). Certain special types of RNA structural motifs are also regarded as tertiary interactions, such as A-minor motif (Nissen et al. 2001), ribose zipper (Cate et al. 1996), and kissing hairpin (Chang and Tinoco 1994).\\n\\nUsing a known RNA motif as the query, RNA structural motif recognition aims to find all of its occurrences in an RNA molecule (i.e., the search space). There are two prevalent ways to search for RNA structural motifs. The first class of methods is to find motifs based on their geometric features. NASSAM (Harrison et al. 2003) represents RNA motifs and the search space by graphs which are constructed using the distances between atoms of key nucleotides. Then the Ullman algorithm is used to search for RNA motifs on the graph. PRIMOS (Duarte et al. 2003), COMPADRES (Wadley and Pyle 2004), and AMIGOS II (Wadley et al. 2007) characterize RNA structures and motifs using two pseudotorsion angles of the backbones. The distance between two RNA substructures can be calculated based on the distances between their pseudotorsion angles. Recently, FASTR3D (Lai et al. 2009), an online server for RNA 3D structure search, also adopts this representation scheme as well as the same distance measure. Different from these methods, FR3D (Sarver et al. 2008), one of the prevalent geometry-based methods, integrates geometry search and symbolic search. When performing geometry search, FR3D uses the base centers of the nucleotides to represent RNA structures and motifs. It measures the fitting error and the orientation error between the query motif and the candidate to compute their overall discrepancy. Additionally, Apostolico et al. (2009) and Sargsyan and Lim (2010) use shape histogram as the signature of RNA motifs. The distance between two RNA substructures is measured by the cosine distance between their shape histograms. The other trend in RNA structural motif recognition is to use an RNA 2D diagram of base pair isostericity to search for motifs. The rationale of RNAMotifScan (Zhong et al. 2010) is based on the assumption that RNA substructures that have isosteric edges to the query...\\nmotif should have similar shapes. Therefore, motifs that are not conserved in sequence can also be found.\\n\\nDespite the great efforts spent in RNA structural motif recognition, there remain several problems for further investigation. The first problem is how to find a suitable representation scheme for RNA structures and query motifs. In geometry-based methods, RNA substructures are represented by sets of atoms or pseudoatoms. Most atoms have fixed positions, and the distances between them will not change dramatically. However, RNA motifs may have some free bases that are allowed to rotate along the backbone. The movement of these atoms will bring in local deformation to the query motif. A suitable representation scheme can remove such kind of deformation and preserve the invariance within a motif type to a large extent. Meanwhile, it should have enough discriminating power to separate those positive instances from the negative ones. The second problem is how to generate candidates. If we simply compare the query motif with all RNA fragments of the same length, the time cost will become unacceptable. Therefore, a candidate generation module that produces a reasonable number of candidates becomes necessary.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose a new method, namely RNA Structural Motif Recognition based on Least-Squares distance (LS-RSMR), which aims to solve the aforementioned problems. LS-RSMR divides the process of RNA structural motif recognition into two steps. First, a moderate-sized set of candidates is generated. Then, these candidates are filtered according to their distances to the query motif. Specifically, for each candidate, LS-RSMR will compute a least-squares distance value by superimposing the candidate on the query motif. Those candidates with smaller distances will be regarded as positive instances.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn the experiments of evaluating the performance of the proposed LS-RSMR, we first construct a query set and a test set using motifs from the HM505 ribosomal RNA (PDB: 1S72) and the Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA (PDB: 2QBE), respectively. Query motifs are selected from the query set, and performance is evaluated on the test set. Meanwhile, we also evaluate four other state-of-the-art methods on the same data set and compare their performance with that of LS-RSMR. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our LS-RSMR method.\\n\\nQuery motif set and search space\\n\\nWe have previously constructed a data set which contains six types (including eight subtypes) of RNA structural motifs in HM505 ribosomal RNA (Shen et al. 2011). In the current experiments, five types of motifs (tetraloop, sarcin/ricin loop, \\u03c0-turn, k-turn, and ribose zipper) are selected to construct a query set. The instances are listed in Supplemental Data Set 1 in the Supplemental Material. The structure alignment along the backbone has been performed and shown in Supplemental Figure S1. The rest of the instances of the same type are aligned to the first motif shown on the list. In the previous work, when evaluating a proposed method, researchers usually arbitrarily chose one of the published motifs as the query. However, for each method, different query motifs will result in different performance. In order to perform an impartial comparison, in our experiments, we select the instance that has the smallest sum of square distance to the other positive instances as the query. The distance between two positive instances is computed using the least-squares distance introduced in Material and Methods. For each query, one instance is selected from the query set and used as the query template. The search is conducted only based on the structure of the selected query motif without any other information of the query set.\\n\\nWe choose another ribosomal RNA, E. coli ribosomal RNA, as the search space. We construct a test set that contains the same types of motifs as in 1S72. The sequences of these motifs are also listed in the Supplemental Material (see Supplemental Data Set 2). Their structure alignment is shown in Supplemental Figure S2. The numbers of motifs in the query set and test set are shown in Supplemental Table S1.\\n\\nAll the positive instances collected in the query set and test set are RNA fragments having consensus structural patterns. The reason is that those fragments having consensus structural patterns will be considered to be the most important during a search. Although some nonstandard fragments will be deemed to be similar to the query motif by certain methods (such as RNAMotifScan), generally they are less important than the standard ones. In addition, without expertise it is difficult to determine whether they are of the same type as that of the query motif. Therefore, those nonstandard fragments are currently not studied in the query and test sets.\\n\\nMethods for performance evaluation\\n\\nIn the following experiments, we search for five types of motifs in 2QBE, and the proposed LS-RSMR is compared with four state-of-the-art methods: FR3D (Sarver et al. 2008), shape histogram used by Apostolico et al. (2009), AMIGOS II (Wadley et al. 2007), and RNAMotifScan (Zhong et al. 2010). The results of FR3D are generated using WebFR3D (Petrov et al. 2011) with only the geometric search function used. Its parameter discrepancy was set to 0.9, which is the largest discrepancy value accepted by WebFR3D. Consequently, WebFR3D could return as many search results as possible and achieves its best performance. The method in Apostolico et al. (2009) has two parameters to adjust: thresholds for cosine distance and RMSD. The default values of cosine distance and RMSD used by the authors are as follows: (0.95, 2 \\u00c5) for tetraloops, (0.9, 4 \\u00c5) for single strand of k-turns, and (0.75, 2 \\u00c5) for \\u03c0-turns. Based on these default values, we adjusted the two thresholds to allow the method to achieve a better performance. In our experiments, when searching for tetraloops, k-turns, and \\u03c0-turns, thresholds for cosine distance and RMSD\\nwere set to (0.95, 2 \\u00c5), (0.85, 2 \\u00c5), and (0.75, 2 \\u00c5), respectively. For the cases of core of sarcin/ricin loops and ribose zippers, the thresholds for cosine distance were both set to 0.9 (RMSD is not considered for the two-loop motifs). When evaluating RNAMotifScan, the threshold (false positive rate) was set to one, which is the largest value of the threshold, so that RNAMotifScan could return the largest number of search results and achieve its best performance.\\n\\nEach method ranks candidates and lists them according to their distances (e.g., discrepancy in FR3D and $d_{LS}$ in LS-RSMR) to the query motif. We plot the ranked lists in a positive/negative space (see Supplemental Fig. S3).\\n\\nIntuitively, the more positive candidates appear at the top of the output list, the more effective is the method. We can quantify this using the precision at rank $k$ [Precision($k$)] measure as defined below:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{Precision}(k) = \\\\frac{\\\\#\\\\text{of true positives in the first } k \\\\text{ instances}}{k}$$\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIn order to quantitatively measure their performance, we adopt the concept of Average Precision (AP) (Zhu 2004; Manning et al. 2008).\\n\\nThe AP values for the results in our experiments can be computed using Eq. (2) below:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{Precision}_{\\\\text{AVG}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} P(k) \\\\times \\\\text{label}(k)}{\\\\#\\\\text{of positive instances in test set}}$$\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nwhere $n$ is the number of ranked candidates, $k$ is the rank in the sequence of candidates, $P(k)$ is the precision at the $k$-th candidate, and label($k$) is 1 if the $k$-th candidate is positive and 0 if the candidate is negative.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nExperiments were performed on a Dell Optiplex 760 (Intel Core2 Duo CPU 3.16 GHz). Results of the five computational methods on searching five types of RNA structural motifs are shown in Supplemental Figure S3. AP values are computed for the five methods and listed in Table 1. The best performance is highlighted in bold.\\n\\nLS-RSMR, FR3D, AMIGOS II, and Apostolico et al. (2009) are geometry-based methods, which accept the coordinates of the same query motif as inputs. However, RNAMotifScan is based on extracted isostericity edges of structural patterns, which is quite different from the other methods. Therefore, in our experiments, we use the same query motif for the first four methods and use the query template provided by RNAMotifScan package for RNAMotifScan. If there is no suitable query template, a template will be created by us, such as the case when searching ribose zippers. In some cases (e.g., k-turn search), the package of AMIGOS II also provides the query template. For this case, we will compute its performance by using the query motif and the query template, and the best performance is chosen and compared with other methods.\\n\\n#### Tetraloop\\n\\nThe query motif used by LS-RSMR, FR3D, Apostolico et al. (2009), and AMIGOS II is 9:G90-A93. There is a GNRA tetraloop template in RNAMotifScan package, and we use it as the query for RNAMotifScan.\\n\\nIn this experiment, FR3D achieves the best performance with its AP value equal to 0.971. Our LS-RSMR method is second best with an AP value of 0.905. The less satisfactory performance of LS-RSMR is due to a false positive in the results of LS-RSMR but that is not found in the output list of FR3D: B:G1807-A1810 (see Supplemental Fig. S4a). We align this sequence with the query motif along the backbone (see Supplemental Fig. S4b). Although it is quite similar to the query motif, we currently consider it as a negative instance.\\n\\n#### Core of sarcin/ricin loop\\n\\nAMIGOS II can only search motifs consisting of a single strand. Therefore, when searching sarcin/ricin loops, only the other four methods are compared. The query motif for LS-RSMR, FR3D, and Apostolico et al. (2009) is 0:G225-A227/A212-A215. The sarcin/ricin loop template in the RNAMotifScan package is used as the query for RNAMotifScan.\\n\\nIn this experiment, LS-RSMR and FR3D successfully find all nine sarcin/ricin loops and achieve the best performance. RNAMotifScan only finds seven loops. Apostolico et al. (2009) identifies six sarcin/ricin loops with a false positive among them.\\n\\n#### \\u03c0-turn\\n\\nWhen searching \\u03c0-turns, we only compare four methods, excepting RNAMotifScan. This is because RNAMotifScan uses a base pair isostericity diagram as input. The user should first define isostericity of base pairs in the query motif. First, \\u03c0-turns consist of only one strand without base pairs inside. Second, the isostericity of base pairs formed between nucleotides in \\u03c0-turns and other residues varies significantly. It is difficult to construct a consensus base pair isostericity matrix for \\u03c0-turns. Therefore, only the other four methods are used to search \\u03c0-turns.\\n\\n### Table 1.

(2009), and AMIGOS II is 0:G1873-G1877. LS-RSMR and Apostolico et al. (2009) successfully find all seven positive instances with AP values equal to one. FR3D and AMIGOS II only find five and three of them, respectively.\\n\\n**K-turn**\\n\\nWe use the characteristic strand to search k-turns so that both local and composite k-turns will be found. The query motif used by LS-RSMR, FR3D, Apostolico et al. (2009), and AMIGOS II is 0:C1146-A1154. The k-turn template in the AMIGOS II package is also used as the query for AMIGOS II. The template in RNAMotifScan package is used as the query for RNAMotifScan.\\n\\nLS-RSMR, FR3D, and Apostolico et al. (2009) find all three k-turns with the highest performance. RNAMotifScan only finds two of them. When using the query motif and the query template, AMIGOS II achieves the same performance\\u2014it only finds two k-turns in both cases.\\n\\n**Ribose zipper**\\n\\nAMIGOS II cannot be used for searching ribose zipper because ribose zipper consists of two strands. We compare the performance of the other four methods. The query motif used by LS-RSMR, FR3D, and Apostolico et al. (2009) is 0: A520-A521/0:C637-C638. Because there is no suitable query template in the RNAMotifScan package, we construct a query template for RNAMotifScan: iso: AA\\u2026CC; edge: SS\\u2026SS; struc: ((\\u22ef)).\\n\\nLS-RSMR achieves the best performance with its AP value equal to 0.914, ~10% higher than the second best method, FR3D. RNAMotifScan only returns four positive instances. Considering that there are 44 ribose zippers in 2QBE, the performance of RNAMotifScan is not satisfactory.\\n\\nResults of the five computational methods show that LS-RSMR identifies more positive instances of all five types of motifs. It achieves a good performance in most cases, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our LS-RSMR method.\\n\\n**NEW MOTIF DISCOVERY**\\n\\nIn the above experiments, we successfully use LS-RSMR to recognize RNA motifs. Next, we will show the effectiveness of LS-RSMR in extracting new motifs.\\n\\nThe RNA motif discovery problem aims to find new structural patterns occurring in RNA molecules. In order to find new motifs, we propose a method based on LS-RSMR. Specifically, we first generate a set of 2-nucleotide (nt) substructures, each of which consists of a pair of neighboring nucleotides along the chain of the RNA molecule. For each substructure, we add a nucleotide whose distance is smaller than 4 \\u00c5 to either nucleotide in the 2-nt substructure. In this way, a set of 3-nt substructures can be obtained. Using LS-RSMR, we perform a search using each 3-nt substructure. Setting a stringent threshold, if there are more than two results returned, we will keep the corresponding substructure and refer to it as a 3-nt seed. After finding all 3-nt seeds, we can construct a 3-nt seed set, which may contain potential 3-nt motifs according to the definition of RNA motifs. Based on this set, we can add a new nucleotide to each of its elements and obtain a 4-nt substructure set. Similarly, using LS-RSMR, we shall check each 4-nt substructure and determine whether or not they are 4-nt seeds.\\n\\nIn this paper, we describe two newly discovered motifs to show the effectiveness of LS-RSMR in new motif extraction.\\n\\nThe first new motif is a tertiary interaction composed of three nucleotides. In this motif, two nucleotides (nt 1 and nt 2 in Fig. 1A) form a consecutive strand, which is part of a helix. The third (nt 3) has interactions with nt 1 and nt 2. Specifically, the base of nt 3 interacts with the 2\\u2032-OH of nt 1. The 2\\u2032-OH of nt 3 interacts with the base and sugar of nt 2. Six occurrences are shown in Figure 1A\\u2013F. This type of motif brings two RNA strands close to each other and a groove, where proteins can be embedded, is formed as a consequence. This unique structure allows proteins and RNA to function together. Figure 1G and H reveal two typical bound structures of this motif with ribosomal proteins.\\n\\nThe second new motif is composed of four consecutive nucleotides. The start and the end nucleotide (nt 1 and nt 4 in Fig. 2A) are part of a helix, and the other two nucleotides (nt...\\n2 and nt 3) form a bulge, which extrudes outside. The bases of nt 2 and nt 3 are parallel and participate in a strand of another helix (see Fig. 2A).\\n\\nThe sequence of this motif is quite conserved. We identified four occurrences, the structures of which are shown in Figure 2B\\u2013E. The sequence pattern of the four occurrences can be summarized as ARYC, where R represents purine and Y represents pyrimidine. We found that the nucleotide at the start position of the 5\\u2032-side is always an adenine and at the end position it is always a cytosine. The bulge extruding out contains a purine and a pyrimidine. The shape of this motif is maintained by the hydrogen bond formed between the 2\\u2032OH of nt 1 and the phosphate group of nt 3 (see Fig. 2A, the hydrogen bond is shown as the yellow dashed line).\\n\\nUsing these two new types of motifs as queries, we conducted two searches across 550 RNA molecules from a non-redundant list (http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/nrlist/release/1.3/all), which includes ribosomal RNAs, ribozymes, and riboswitches. Using two stringent cutoff values ($d_0 = 5$ for the first new motif and $d_0 = 10$ for the second motif), we identified 45 instances of the first new motif in 17 RNA molecules and 55 instances of the second motif in 31 RNA molecules (see Supplemental Table S3, S4). We find that these instances possess consensus structural patterns, and their structures are conserved across species and different types of RNAs.\\n\\nThese newly discovered motifs indicate that LS-RSMR is effective to find similar substructures according to the given template from different types of RNA molecules. It is effective not only for the known RNA motifs, but also for unknown substructures.\\n\\n**DISCUSSION**\\n\\nIn RNA motif recognition, LS-RSMR, when compared with FR3D, produces fewer candidates. For example, when searching ribose zipper in 2QBE, LS-RSMR returns 399 candidates, whereas FR3D returns 12,323 candidates. Meanwhile, in the candidate set of LS-RSMR, there are more positive instances than that of FR3D. A positive candidate of ribose zipper, B: G2607-G2608/U1782-A1783 (see Fig. 3), is found by LS-RSMR but does not appear in the candidate list of FR3D.\\n\\nWhen using FR3D to search RNA motifs, if there is no continuity information, FR3D will take a much longer time (>10 min) to generate candidates and return search results. However, without any continuity constraint, LS-RSMR can generate candidates within 1 min. In addition, our representation scheme utilizes information from more atoms of the motifs than FR3D, which increases the discriminating power.\\n\\nLS-RSMR has only one parameter: a cutoff threshold $d_0$. Users can easily filter candidates by setting a suitable cutoff value. Other methods, such as AMIGOS II and Apostolico et al. (2009), have more than one parameter that needs to be set.\\n\\nLS-RSMR recognizes RNA motifs based on the degree of structural similarity. Compared with RNAMotifScan, it does not require extra knowledge on base pair isostericity. The query can be a single strand in which there can even be no base pair. In addition, when searching motifs that have no consensus base pair isostericity, e.g., \\u03c0-turns, ribose zipper, its effectiveness is further highlighted.\\n\\nLS-RSMR can search both local and composite motifs. In the candidate generation process, nucleotides are added to the partial candidates as long as they have interaction with the existing nucleotides. It does not matter whether they are in the same strand of the partial candidates or not.\\n\\n**CONCLUSIONS**\\n\\nIn this paper, we have proposed a new method, namely LS-RSMR, for RNA structural motif recognition. To quantitatively measure the performance of LS-RSMR, we apply it to search for five types of motifs occurring in 2QBE. We also compare the performance of LS-RSMR with four other state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.\\n\\nIn addition to its effectiveness, LS-RSMR has three other advantages. First, only one parameter is required to be adjusted, which makes it easy to use. Second, it is capable of searching both local and composite motifs. Third, to start a search, it only requires the residue sequence numbers of the query.\\n\\n**FIGURE 2.** (A) The formation of the second new motif (0:A339-C342) in the HM50S subunit.

Currently, we successfully find two new motifs. These new discoveries further demonstrate the power of LS-RSMR in RNA substructure recognition.\\n\\nIn the near future, we plan to extend LS-RSMR to allow users to set constraints on the relationship between nucleotides in the generated candidates. The idea of symbolic search, which has been adopted by FR3D, will also be considered as our future work.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\n\\nRNA structural motif\\n\\nRNA structural motifs are recurrent substructures occurring in RNA molecules. They are building blocks of RNA tertiary structures and are important for RNAs fulfilling their biological functions. Many types of motifs have been discovered, such as tetraloop, sarcin/ricin loop, kink-turn, \\u03c0-turn, and ribose zipper. They are briefly introduced in the Supplemental Material.\\n\\nRepresentative structure of an RNA motif\\n\\nMotifs in the same class share a similar structure. In general, their structures are similar but tiny differences exist, especially in the positions of some unrestricted bases. Since RNA motifs are largely invariant but slightly different due to local variations, the problem is how to find a representation scheme to preserve their identity and at the same time to have adequate discriminating power. Reijmers et al. (2001) argues that Cartesian coordinates is the most basic representation for RNA structures and other representations, such as torsion angles, can be deduced from it. Duarte et al. (2003) and Apostolico et al. (2009) use backbones as the representative structures of RNA motifs because backbones of motifs are relatively stable and similar within a class. On the other hand, FR3D (Sarver et al. 2008) utilizes the centroids of the bases as the representation of RNA structures.\\n\\nAfter re-examining the structures of motifs, we found that the atoms from the backbone (including the phosphate group and sugar, i.e., P, OP1, OP2, C1\\u2032, C2\\u2032, C3\\u2032, C4\\u2032, C5\\u2032, O2\\u2032, O3\\u2032, O4\\u2032, and O5\\u2032) and the centers of the bases form a stable representative structure (see Fig. 4). Such a representation scheme can balance the impact of backbone and bases on the structural identity of RNA motifs to a certain extent. Since the number of atoms from the backbone is much larger than the base centers, once a candidate matches the query motif in their backbones, the difference in the base centers will not significantly affect the final matching score. Meanwhile, the positions of the base centers can help to align the candidate with the query motif. An only concern of using this representation scheme is that it may allow fragments that have rotated bases to appear in the results, such as the instance shown in Supplemental Figure S4.\\n\\nLeast-squares distance between two representative structures\\n\\nSimilar to the approach adopted by FR3D, RNA structural motif recognition is partitioned into two phases by using the proposed LS-RSMR: the candidate generation phase and the candidate filtering phase. In this section, we describe the second phase in which candidates are filtered based on a least-squares distance measure. Specifically, we shall first introduce the least-squares distance measure and the candidate filtering method. The method for candidate generation will be described in \\u201cCandidate generation.\\u201d\\n\\nSuppose we have a set of candidates. The process of candidate filtering is that, given a query motif, each candidate will be compared with the query. A discrepancy value between each candidate and the query motif can be computed using a suitable distance measure. Candidates with smaller distances will be regarded as positive instances.\\n\\nUnder the representation scheme introduced previously, the RNA substructures, including query motif and candidates, can be treated as rigid objects. The distance between them can be measured by the sum of Euclidean distances between the corresponding atoms after a suitable linear transformation. The computational details can be found in the Supplemental Material.\\n\\nIn the problem of RNA structural motif recognition, we assume that there is no scale change between the two RNA substructures to be matched. Therefore, the scale factor s in Supplemental Equation S1 is set to 1, instead of using the solution given by Supplemental Equation S2. We can compute a least-squares distance \\\\( d_{LS} \\\\) using Supplemental Equations S1 and S2 between each candidate and the query motif. Given a threshold \\\\( d_0 \\\\), candidates whose \\\\( d_{LS} \\\\) values are smaller than \\\\( d_0 \\\\) will be regarded as positive instances and listed in ascending order of \\\\( d_{LS} \\\\). How to set \\\\( d_0 \\\\) will be discussed at the end of \\u201cCandidate generation.\\u201d\\n\\nLeast-squares distance is also adopted by FR3D and some protein alignment methods (McLachlan 1979). We found that compared with other distance measures, least-squares distance has the best discriminating power in Euclidean space. Therefore, LS-RSMR also adopts this distance measure for RNA substructure comparison. Although both LS-RSMR and FR3D use the same distance measure, the computed rotation matrices and translation vectors are different. This is because points in the representative structures constructed by the two methods are quite different; and consequently, the transformation parameters are also different. In addition, FR3D also incorporates an orientation error in addition to the least-squares fitting error. As a consequence, the search results of LS-RSMR are different from the results of FR3D.\\n\\nCandidate generation\\n\\nSuppose the query motif contains \\\\( m \\\\) nucleotides, the first stage of RNA structural motif recognition is to generate all possible \\\\( n\\\\)-nt RNA fragments in the search space. Specifically, given a search space\\nthat contains \\\\( n \\\\) nucleotides, the number of all \\\\( m \\\\)-nt fragments will be \\\\( n(n-1), \\\\ldots, (n-m) \\\\), i.e., \\\\( O(n^m) \\\\). When \\\\( n \\\\) is large, it is inefficient to retain this many candidates and compute their distances to the query motif. In view of this, an efficient candidate generation method is indispensable so that fewer candidates can be produced for filtering in the next phase. Previously, FR3D proposed a fast and efficient screening algorithm for determining a reasonable number of candidates. On the other hand, in LS-RSMR, we adopt a different, yet also efficient, candidate generation scheme for this purpose.\\n\\nOur candidate generation method consists of two steps. The first step is to reorder the nucleotides in the query motif. The second step is to generate candidates in the search space according to the new order of the query motif.\\n\\nDetermine a new order of nucleotides in the query motif\\n\\nThe sequence of nucleotides in the query motif is given by the user. We should first reorganize the sequence of these nucleotides so that in the second step candidates can be generated in a more efficient way. The pseudocode is shown in Supplemental Table S2. The process of reordering the query motif is as follows. Suppose the query motif contains \\\\( m \\\\) nucleotides. We first construct a distance matrix \\\\( D = [d_{ij}]_{i,j=1, \\\\ldots, m} \\\\). Each entry of \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( d_{ij} \\\\), is the smallest distance between atoms in nucleotides \\\\( i \\\\) and \\\\( j \\\\). Next, we will construct two lists. One of them is \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{new}} = \\\\left\\\\{ n_i' \\\\right\\\\}_{i=1, \\\\ldots, m} \\\\), which contains the new order of nucleotides in the query. The other is \\\\( \\\\text{ClosestPairs} = \\\\{(n_i', n_j')\\\\}_{i=1, \\\\ldots, m}^{j=1, \\\\ldots, m} \\\\). \\\\( (n_i', n_j') \\\\) means \\\\( n_j' \\\\) is the closest nucleotide to \\\\( n_i' \\\\) in the first \\\\( j-1 \\\\) nucleotides of \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{new}} \\\\).\\n\\nSuppose the given sequence of a query motif is \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{rem}} = \\\\left\\\\{ n_i, n_j, \\\\ldots, n_m \\\\right\\\\} \\\\). First, we set \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{new}} = \\\\left\\\\{ n_i = n_1 \\\\right\\\\} \\\\). Then, we set \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{remain}} = \\\\left\\\\{ n_1, n_2, \\\\ldots, n_m \\\\right\\\\} \\\\). We can always find a nucleotide \\\\( n_0 \\\\), which has the smallest minimum distance to one of the members in \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{new}} \\\\). Suppose \\\\( n_i' \\\\) is the nucleotide closest to \\\\( n_0 \\\\) in \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{new}} \\\\) then we set \\\\( n_{k+1} = n_i \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{rem}} = \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{rem}} \\\\setminus n_0 \\\\) and \\\\( (n_i', n_{k+1}) \\\\) will be added to \\\\( \\\\text{ClosestPairs} \\\\). This process is repeated until \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{new}} \\\\) contains all \\\\( m \\\\) nucleotides.\\n\\nConstruct candidates\\n\\nBased on the two lists: \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{new}} = \\\\left\\\\{ n_i', n_j', \\\\ldots, n_m' \\\\right\\\\} \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\text{ClosestPairs} = \\\\left\\\\{ (n_i', n_j') \\\\right\\\\}_{i=1, \\\\ldots, m}^{j=1, \\\\ldots, m} \\\\), we can now construct the candidates.\\n\\nFirst, we select any one of the nucleotides in the search space and denote it by \\\\( c_1 \\\\). Now a partial candidate containing only one nucleotide has been created. Next, we should find the second nucleotide \\\\( c_2 \\\\) such that \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2\\\\} \\\\) is similar to \\\\( (n_i', n_j') \\\\) in \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{new}} \\\\). The similarity between \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( (n_i', n_j') \\\\) can be measured by Supplemental Equation S1. If the distance between \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( (n_i', n_j') \\\\) is smaller than a threshold \\\\( d_2 \\\\), then \\\\( c_2 \\\\) will be kept and \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2\\\\} \\\\) forms a new partial candidate.\\n\\nThe naive way to choose \\\\( c_2 \\\\) from the search space is to check all the nucleotides in the search space and see whether its combination with \\\\( c_1 \\\\) satisfies the similarity constraint. However, this is time consuming considering that there are thousands of nucleotides in the search space. When observing the first two nucleotides in \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{new}} \\\\), it can be found that \\\\( n_i' \\\\) is the closest nucleotide to \\\\( n_j' \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( c_1 \\\\) should also be close to \\\\( c_2 \\\\) if \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( (n_i', n_j') \\\\) are similar. This means \\\\( c_1 \\\\) and \\\\( c_2 \\\\) are either neighbors along the chain or they have an interaction. If \\\\( c_1 \\\\) and \\\\( c_2 \\\\) are neighbors along the chain, their smallest distance is \\\\(<2 \\\\text{ \\u00c5} \\\\). If they have an interaction, their distance should be \\\\(<4 \\\\text{ \\u00c5} \\\\). Based on this observation, when selecting a suitable \\\\( c_2 \\\\), we only need to check the neighbors of \\\\( c_1 \\\\) that are located within a distance of \\\\( 4 \\\\text{ \\u00c5} \\\\) (in practice, we relax this distance constraint to \\\\( 10 \\\\text{ \\u00c5} \\\\) to avoid missing some nucleotides not in the standard position). This operation greatly reduces the number of nucleotides for checking. It should be noted that our method relies on finding a chain of nearest neighbors. As long as the chain has distances below \\\\( 10 \\\\text{ \\u00c5} \\\\) in distinct parts of the query motif, our method will perform well.\\n\\nNow suppose we have a partial candidate containing \\\\( k \\\\) \\\\((k < m)\\\\) nucleotides: \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k\\\\} \\\\). We will now add a new residue \\\\( c_{k+1} \\\\). Similar to the case of \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2\\\\} \\\\), we first check \\\\( \\\\text{ClosestPairs} \\\\) to find the pair \\\\((n_i', n_j')\\\\), \\\\((n_i', n_j')\\\\) means \\\\( n_i' \\\\) is the closest nucleotide to \\\\( n_{k+1} \\\\) when considering the first \\\\( k \\\\) nucleotides of \\\\( \\\\text{Seq}_{\\\\text{new}} \\\\). Then, we turn to the \\\\( j \\\\)-th nucleotide \\\\( c_j \\\\) in the partial candidate and find all its neighbors within \\\\( 10 \\\\text{ \\u00c5} \\\\) in the search space. By adding each neighbor to \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k\\\\} \\\\), respectively, we can construct several new partial candidates in the form of \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k, \\\\ldots, c_j\\\\} \\\\). We then check the distance \\\\( d_{k+1} \\\\) between \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k, \\\\ldots, c_j\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\{n_i', n_j', \\\\ldots, n_{k+1}'\\\\} \\\\). If the \\\\( d_{k+1} \\\\) value is smaller than the threshold \\\\( d_{k+1} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k, \\\\ldots, c_{k+1}\\\\} \\\\) will be regarded as a new partial candidate. When there are \\\\( m \\\\) nucleotides in each candidate, this process will stop. By changing \\\\( c_1 \\\\) to different nucleotides in the search space, a complete candidate set can be constructed.\\n\\nIn the previous process, there is a threshold \\\\( d_k \\\\) (\\\\( k = 2, \\\\ldots, m-1 \\\\)) used for filtering partial candidates with \\\\( k \\\\) nucleotides. Next we shall explain the relationship between \\\\( d_k \\\\) and \\\\( d_k \\\\) as well as how to set their values. Suppose the query motif is \\\\( \\\\{q_1, q_2, \\\\ldots, q_m\\\\} \\\\) (which has been reordered using the algorithm in Supplemental Table S2). The least-squares distance \\\\( d_{k+1} \\\\) of a candidate \\\\( \\\\{c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k\\\\} \\\\) to the query is supposed to be smaller than \\\\( d_0 \\\\). The corresponding rotation matrix and translation vector for \\\\( m \\\\) nucleotides is denoted by \\\\( R_1 \\\\) and \\\\( t_1 \\\\), respectively. When only the first \\\\( k \\\\) nucleotides of the query motif and the candidate are considered, the optimal rotation matrix and translation vector are denoted by \\\\( R_2 \\\\) and \\\\( t_2 \\\\). It is obvious that\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{l} |q_{ij} - (R_2(c_i) + t_2)|^2 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\leq \\\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{l} |q_{ij} - (R_1(c_i) + t_1)|^2 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\leq \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m} |q_{ij} - (R_1(c_i) + t_1)|^2 \\\\leq d_0\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( q_{ij} \\\\) and \\\\( c_i \\\\) are the \\\\( j \\\\)-th points in \\\\( q_i \\\\) and \\\\( c_i \\\\), and \\\\( l \\\\) is the number of points in \\\\( q_i \\\\) (\\\\( c_i \\\\)).\\n\\nEquation 3 means that, if the least-squares distance of a candidate is smaller than \\\\( d_0 \\\\), all its \\\\( k \\\\)-nt substructures should also have a least-squares distance smaller than \\\\( d_0 \\\\) when compared with the corresponding \\\\( k \\\\)-nt subsequence of the query motif. If a \\\\( k \\\\)-nt RNA fragment has a least-squares distance larger than \\\\( d_0 \\\\), all \\\\( m \\\\)-nt candidates starting with it will not be regarded as positive instances in the filtering process. This means that \\\\( d_k \\\\) is the upper bound of \\\\( d_0 \\\\).\\n\\nIn Figure 5, we have plotted the relationship between \\\\( k \\\\) and \\n\\n\\\\[\\nd_{k+1}(k) = d_k^{(0)} \\\\quad \\\\text{(under the assumption that there are} \\\\ l \\\\text{ representative points in each nucleotide and} \\\\ n \\\\text{ is set to} \\\\ l \\\\text{ in Supplemental Equation S1)}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nbased on positive instances of tetraloop, sarcin/rincin loop, \\u03c0-turn, k-turn, and ribose zipper in two RNA subunits (PDB: 1S72 and 2QBE). We choose one of the positive instances in each type.\\nas the query and compute the distances of the other positive instances to the query. The dashed lines correspond to instances from 1S72 and solid lines for instances from 2QBE. It is obvious that $d_{\\\\text{LS}}(k)$ always increases with $k$. The largest value of $d_0$ can be estimated as $4m$ ($m$ is the number of nucleotides in the query). For motifs with moderate length (ranging from ~3 to 10 nt), the estimated value is large enough to include all the positive instances and guarantees the computational efficiency simultaneously. However, for some large motifs (>10 nt), the estimated value may be a bit high, which may lead to heavy computation. Instead, for these cases, we suggest using a value smaller than $4m$. The adjustment of $d_0$ will not affect the order of search results but the number of instances shown in the results. A smaller $d_0$ corresponds to a smaller number of search results and vice versa. Therefore, when the length of motif is larger than 10 nt, we suggest that users adopt a smaller value of $d_0$. If the returned instances are all positive, $d_0$ can be increased until enough negative instances appear at the end of the list, which means that most of the positives instances are found.\\n\\nIn Figure 5, sometimes the estimated value of $d_0$ is much larger than $d_{\\\\text{LS}}(k)$, especially when $k$ is small. If we use $d_0$ to filter small partial candidates, most of them will be kept at the beginning of the candidate generation step, which consequently affects the speed of the method. In order to achieve a higher efficiency, we set the value of $d_0$ as the smaller value between $d_0$ and $6k$ so that fewer small partial candidates will be kept.\\n\\nLS-RSMR\\n\\nGiven a query motif and a cutoff threshold $d_0$, LS-RSMR first determines the new sequence order of the query using the algorithm in Supplemental Table S2. Then, the algorithm will generate candidates according to this new query motif sequence order. After that, each candidate will be superimposed on the query motif and a least-squares distance will be computed using Supplemental Equation S1. Candidates whose least-squares distance values are less than $d_0$ will be retained as the positive instances.\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL\\n\\nSupplemental material is available for this article, and codes of LS-RSMR are available at http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/yingshen/RSMR/LS_RSMR.html.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nThe work described in this paper is partially supported by a grant from the City University of Hong Kong (Project No. 7002771), the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61201394 and No. 61202273, and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (Project No. S2012040007206).\\n\\nReceived December 9, 2012; accepted June 13, 2013.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nApostolico A, Ciriello G, Guerra C, Heitsch CE, Hsiao C, Williams LD. 2009.

An incomplete, poorly prepared or inaccurate application may:\\n- Result in rejection of the application\\n- Raise doubts about the applicant\\u2019s ability to control the operation\\n- Result in delays\\n- Add to the cost of the ReOC\\n- Result in a refusal to issue the ReOC\\n\\nPlease remember it is an offence to make a false declaration in this form.\\n\\nIf you are filling in the form by hand, print neatly with a black or blue ballpoint pen. Some questions contain check boxes. Please mark X where appropriate. This information is used in the calculation of a cost estimate for the assessment of your application. Questions marked with an asterisk (*) are mandatory and must be completed.\\n\\nSubmitting your application\\nAfter reviewing your application, CASA will advise you if any additional information is required to be submitted. Submit the completed application and proof of ID, to the CASA Permissions Issue Team by email at regservices@casa.gov.au.\\n\\nIf at any time you would like assistance with any aspect of this form, please contact the Permissions Issue Team on 136 773.\\n\\nApplicants are required to complete and submit ALL parts of the application to be acceptable to CASA.\\n\\nThe completion of this application form is the first step in the application process.

CASA is bound by the Privacy Act to safeguard personal information within the terms of the Act.\\n\\nProviding CASA with correct information requested in this application will avoid delays caused by poor or insufficient information.\\nGUIDELINES FOR COMPLETING THIS APPLICATION FORM\\n\\nPart A \\u2013 Details of Applicant(s)\\n\\nPlease note that in the guidelines and application form the proposed certificate holder is referred to as the \\u2018applicant\\u2019. The name of the applicant given in A3 or A4 is the name that will appear on the certificate.\\n\\nIn this section, you are required to provide the details of the applicant. The law requires that the ReOC holder must be a natural person or have legal personality (capable of enjoying and being subject to legal rights and duties) that is:\\n\\n- a natural person;\\n- an incorporated company;\\n- body corporate or politic created by statute.\\n\\nIf the applicant does not meet the above criteria, the application will not be accepted.\\n\\nA3. If the applicant is an individual, provide the complete name, date of birth, address, contact details and ARN (if you have one). Individuals must provide documentation as proof of identity, unless the documentation has previously been supplied to the Permissions Issue Team or the nominee is the holder of a valid license issued by CASA.\\n\\nCASA adopts a standard 100 points verification system similar to that outlined in the Financial Transaction Reports Regulations 1990. CASA will verify your proof of ID.\\n\\nA4. If the applicant is a legal entity other than an individual, provide the name of the legal entity as registered in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the ACN or ARBN and the ARN (if the legal entity has one).\\n\\nA Trust is not a legal entity and therefore cannot hold a ReOC under CASR Part 101.270. A trustee is the legal entity (being an individual or incorporated body) and can hold a ReOC.\\n\\nA5. The trading name must meet the following criteria:\\n\\n- Registration must be current at the time of issue of the ReOC; and\\n- It must be registered under the name/s of the proposed ReOC holder/s (as proprietor/s) at the time of issue of the ReOC.\\n\\nCASA will verify the currency of registration of the trading name and the ownership of the trading name as registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). If the trading name does not meet the criteria at the time of verification, your ReOC will be issued without the trading name.\\n\\nA7. You may by law appoint an agent to complete and sign the application on your behalf and to negotiate with CASA in relation to all matters necessary to complete the AOC application.\\n\\nIf you wish to authorise an agent to act on your behalf, CASA requires that the agent be appointed under a Power of Attorney. The Power of Attorney must be executed and signed by all applicants or in the case of a company by a Director of that company. CASA will consider the authority of the agent to have ceased once the ReOC has been issued.\\n\\nA9. Criminal action means any action where legal proceeding commenced by the Commonwealth, a State or Territory against a person arising from the commission or alleged commission of an offence.\\n\\nA10. Regulatory action means an action taken against a person by CASA (in relation to Australia) or by a person representing a foreign regulatory authority (in relation to a foreign country) that, on conviction, may lead to the imposition of a fine or a variation, suspension or cancellation of a ReOC or civil aviation authorisation.\\n\\nPart B \\u2013 Details of Proposed Operations\\n\\nB1. Provide details indicating which remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) operations you wish to undertake and the details of the RPA you wish to operate. Your operations manual will need to provide guidance material for all operations sought.\\n\\nIf either RePL Training option is selected then your completed training syllabus must also be submitted. RePL Training could be obtained either:\\n\\n- From an organisation with CASA approved RePL training; or\\n- As part of in-house training conducted by an organisation who holds a Remote Operator\\u2019s Certificate (ReOC).\\nForm 101-02\\nApplication for RPA Operator's Certificate (ReOC)\\nInitial Issue and Variation\\n\\nPart C \\u2013 Applicant(s) Declaration\\nBy signing the Declaration, you indicate to CASA that you have read the guidelines, completed the application in full, supplied proof of identification, accept the terms and conditions for processing your application and agree to the publication of your ReOC details on the CASA website.

See section 4.5.2 for more information about the connectors. The audio interface consists of three main ICs, an AD1836, AD1852 and a CS8414.\\n\\nThe AD1836 multi-channel codec features six digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and four analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), support multiple digital stereo channels with 24-bit conversion resolution and a 96 kHz sample rate. The AD1836 features a 108 dB dynamic range for each of its six DACs, and a 104 dB dynamic range for its four ADCs.\\n\\nThe AD1852 is a complete 18/20/24-bit single-chip stereo digital audio playback system. It is comprised of a multibit sigma-delta modulator, digital interpolation filters, and analog output drive circuitry. Other features include an on-chip stereo attenuator and mute, programmed through an SPI-compatible serial control port. The AD1852 is fully compatible with all known DVD formats including 192kHz and 96kHz sample frequencies and 24-bits. It also is backwards compatible by supporting 50/15\\u00b5s digital de-emphasis intended for \\\"redbook\\\" Compact Discs, as well as de-emphasis at 32kHz and 48kHz sample rate.\\n\\nThe CS8414 is a monolithic CMOS device that receives and decodes audio data up to 96kHz according to the AES/EBU, IEC958, S/PDIF, and EIAJ CP340/1201 interface standards. The CS8414 receives data from a transmission line, recovers the clock and synchronization signals, and de-multiplexes the audio and digital data. The CS8414 is setup to operate in I\\\\(^2\\\\)S compatible mode.\\nThe Microphone and Line-In jacks connect to the left and right ADC1 channel on the AD1836, depending on the setting of jumpers. See sections 4.3.9 and 4.3.8 for more information about configuring the jumpers. Two RCA jacks connect to ADC2 on the AD1836. This input is configured through the input mode selection jumpers see section 4.3.7 for more information.\\n\\nThe Line-Out jacks connect to the left and right DAC outputs of the AD1836 and AD1852.\\n\\nThe CS8414 has an error flag (VERF) that is used to indicate that the audio output may not be valid. This signal is connected to an LED (LED9) on the board. This signal may also be used by interpolation filters to provide error correction.\\n\\n### 3.8 Example Programs\\n\\nExample programs are provided with the ADSP-21161N EZ-KIT Lite to demonstrate various capabilities of the evaluation board. These programs are installed with the EZ-KIT Lite software and can be found in \\\\...\\\\VisualDSP\\\\211xx\\\\EZ-KITs\\\\ADSP-21161N\\\\Examples. Please refer to the example program readme files for more information.\\n\\n### 3.9 Using the Flash Programmer Utility\\n\\nThe ADSP-21161N EZ-KIT Lite evaluation system includes a flash programmer utility.

To install the utility, insert the EZ-KIT Lite CD-ROM and follow the steps in the installation wizard.\\n\\nFor more information on the flash programmer utility, from the start menu choose Programs\\\\VisualDSP\\\\Flash Programmer Help.\\n4 EZ-KIT LITE HARDWARE REFERENCE\\n\\n4.1 Overview\\n\\nThis chapter describes the hardware design of the ADSP-21161N EZ-KIT Lite board. The following topics are covered:\\n\\n- **System Architecture** (Section 4.2)\\n  Describes the configuration of the DSP as well as a description of how all of the components on the board interface with the DSP.\\n\\n- **Jumper Settings** (Section 4.3)\\n  Shows the location and describes the function of all the configuration jumpers.\\n\\n- **LEDs and Push Buttons** (Section 4.4)\\n  Shows the location and describes the function of all the LEDs and push buttons.\\n\\n- **Connectors** (Section 4.5)\\n  Shows the location and gives the part number for all of the connectors on the board. Also, the manufacturer and part number information is given for the mating part.\\n\\n- **Specifications** (Section 4.6)\\n  Gives the requirements for powering the board as well as the mechanical locations of some components of the board.\\n4.2 System Architecture\\n\\nThe EZ-KIT Lite has been designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the ADSP-21161N DSP. This section will describe the DSP\\u2019s configuration on the EZ-KIT Lite board.\\n\\n![System Architecture Diagram](image)\\n\\n**Figure 4-1: System Architecture**\\n\\nThe DSP core voltage is 1.8V and the external interface operates at 3.3V.\\n\\nA 12.5MHz through-hole oscillator supplies the input clock to the DSP. Footprints are provided on the board for a surface-mount oscillator and a through-hole crystal for alternate user installed clocks. The speed at which the core operates is determined by the location of the Clock Mode jumpers (JP21). (See section 4.3.12.) By default, the DSP core runs at 100MHz.\\n4.2.1 External Port\\n\\nThe external port is connected to a 512K x 8-bit flash memory. This memory is connected to the boot memory select (~BMS) pin and the memory select 1 (~MS1) pin, allowing the flash memory to be used to boot the DSP as well as store information during normal operation. Refer to section 3.3 for information about the location of the flash memory in the DSP\\u2019s memory map.\\n\\nThe external memory interface is also connected to 1M x 48-bit SDRAM memory. This memory is connected to the memory select 0 (~MS0) pin. Refer to section 4.3.1 for information about configuring the width of the SDRAM. Refer to section 3.3 for information about the location of the flash memory in the DSP\\u2019s memory map.\\n\\nSome of the address, data, and control signals are available externally via two off-board connectors. The pinout of the EP connectors (P9 and P10) can be found in APPENDIX B: SCHEMATIC.\\n\\n4.2.2 Host Processor Interface (HPI)\\n\\nThe Host Port Interface (HPI) signals are brought to an unpopulated off board connector P9. This allows the HPI to interface to a user application. The pinout of the host port connector (P9) can be found in APPENDIX B: SCHEMATIC.\\n\\n4.2.3 SPORT0 and SPORT2 \\u2013 Audio Interface\\n\\nSPORT0 and SPORT2 are connected to the AD1836 codec (U10). A 3.5mm stereo jack and four RCA mono jacks allow audio to be input. A 3.5mm stereo jack and eight RCA mono jacks allow audio to be output.\\n\\nThe codec contains two input channels. One channel is connected to a 3.5mm stereo jack and two RCA jacks. The 3.5mm stereo jack can be connected to a microphone. The two RCA jacks can be connected to a line out from an audio device. You can supply an audio input to the codec microphone input channel (MIC1) or to the LINE_IN input channel. The jumper settings of JP1 determine the codec channel driven by the input jack (P3).\\n\\n4.2.4 SPI - Audio Interface\\n\\nThe SPI is connected to the AD1836 and AD1852. This is used for writing and reading from control registers on the devices.\\n4.2.5 Breadboard Area\\n\\nUse the breadboard area to add external circuitry.\\n\\n- All board voltages and grounds\\n- Package Footprints\\n  - 1x SOIC16\\n  - 1x SOIC20\\n  - 4x SOT23-6\\n  - 1x PSOP44\\n  - 2x SOT23\\n  - 27x 0805\\n\\n\\u27a2 Warning: Any circuitry added to the breadboard area is not supported.\\n\\n4.2.6 JTAG Emulation Port\\n\\nThe JTAG emulation port allows an emulator to access the DSP\\u2019s internal and external memory, as well as the special function registers through a 14-pin header. See section 4.5.5 for more information about the JTAG connector. To learn more about available emulators, contact Analog Devices (See section 1.1).\\n\\n4.3 Jumper Settings\\n\\nThis section describes the function of all the jumpers. The following figure shows the location of all the jumpers.\\n4.3.1 SDRAM Disable (JP1)\\n\\nJP1 is used to enable or disable the third SDRAM device. When this jumper is installed, the ADSP-21161N can access the SDRAM as 48-bit wide external memory.\\n\\nThe upper 16 bits of data are multiplexed with the Link Ports and the external data bus. Therefore when the jumper is installed the Link Ports are not available. To use the Link Ports this jumper must be removed.\\n4.3.2 SPDIF Selection Jumper (JP2)\\n\\nJP2 is used to select the SPDIF input to the CS8414 Digital Audio Receiver. When the jumper is configured for an optical connection the TOSLINK optical input connector (P4) should be used. When the jumper is configured for a coax connection the RCA input connector (P5) should be used.\\n\\nTable 4-1: SPDIF Modes\\n\\n| Jumper Location | Mode                          |\\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|\\n| 1 & 2           | Optical (factory default)     |\\n| 2 & 3           | Coax                          |\\n\\n4.3.3 MCLK Selection Jumper (JP3)\\n\\nJP3 is used to select the MCLK source for the AD1836 and AD1852.\\n\\nTable 4-2: MCLK Selection\\n\\n| Jumper Location | MCLK Source                             |\\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|\\n| 1 & 2           | Audio Oscillator (12.288 MHz) (factory default) |\\n| 2 & 3           | Derived clock from SPDIF Stream         |\\n\\n4.3.4 FLAG0 Enable (JP4)\\n\\nIn standard configuration, FLAG1 is connected to the AD1836 and used as a select for the SPI port. This jumper should be removed to use the push button switch or the signal on the expansion connector (P10). Once this jumper is removed the SPI can no longer communicate with the AD1836.\\n\\n4.3.5 FLAG1 Enable (JP5)\\n\\nIn standard configuration, FLAG1 is connected to the AD1852 and used as a select for the SPI port. This jumper should be removed to use the push button switch or the signal on the expansion connector (P10). Once this jumper is removed the SPI can no longer communicate with the AD1852.\\n\\n4.3.6 Sample Frequency Jumper (JP6)\\n\\nJP6 is used to select the sample frequency for the AD1852. Table 4-3 shows the valid modes that may be used.\\nTable 4-3: Sample Frequencies\\n\\n| Jumper Location | Sample Frequency                      |\\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------|\\n| None installed  | Not Allowed                           |\\n| 3 & 4           | 192 kHz (2x Interpolator)             |\\n| 1 & 2           | 96 kHz (4x Interpolator)              |\\n| 1 & 2, 3 & 4    | 48 kHz (8x Interpolator) (factory default) |\\n\\n4.3.7 ADC2 Input Mode Selection Jumper (JP7 and JP8)\\n\\nJP7 and JP8 control the input mode to ADC2 on the AD1836. In high-performance mode, the signal is routed straight in to the ADC. In PGA mode, the signal goes through a multiplexer and a programmable gain amplifier inside of the codec.\\n\\nTable 4-4: ADC Input Mode\\n\\n| Jumper Location | Input Mode                      |\\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\\n| 3 & 5, 4 & 6    | PGA (factory default)          |\\n| 1 & 3, 2 & 4    | High Performance               |\\n\\n4.3.8 MIC Pre-Amp Gain Selection Jumpers (JP9 and JP10)\\n\\nJP9 and JP10 are used to select the pre-amp gain for the microphone circuit. The gain for the left and right channel should be configured the same.\\n\\nTable 4-5: MIC Pre Amp Gain\\n\\n| Jumper Position | Gain                      |\\n|-----------------|---------------------------|\\n| Not Installed   | 0dB                       |\\n| 1 & 2           | 20dB                      |\\n| 2 & 3           | 40dB (factory default)    |\\n\\n4.3.9 ADC1 Input Selector Jumper (JP11)\\n\\nJP11 is used to select the input source for ADC2. If the input source for ADC2 is Line-In then the RCA connector P6 should be used. If the input source for ADC2 is a microphone then the mini stereo plug P7 should be used. If a microphone is used, the gain of the circuit may be increased as described in the section 4.3.8.\\nWhen the JP11 jumpers are between pins 1 and 3 and between pins 2 and 4, the connection is to P7. When the jumpers are between pins 3 and 5 and between pins 4 and 6, P3 the connection is to P6. The jumper settings are illustrated below. (The words MIC and LINE are on the board to give a reference)\\n\\n| Microphone Input | Stereo LINE_IN (DEFAULT) |\\n|------------------|--------------------------|\\n| ![JP11 Diagram](image1) | ![JP11 Diagram](image2) |\\n\\n![Figure 4-3: Audio Input Jumper Settings](image3)\\n\\n### 4.3.10 Processor ID Jumpers (JP19)\\n\\nJP19 is used to select different processor ID for the DSP. During typical operation of the EZ-KIT Lite board, there is only a single DSP in the system. The jumper should be set to the single processor setting. In the case where a second processor is attached to the board though the link port these jumpers should be changed to configure one board for processor 1 and the other board for processor 2.

The frequency supplied to CLKIN of the DSP may be changed by removing the 12.5 MHz oscillator (U24) that is shipped with the board and replacing it with a different oscillator or crystal (Y2). A clock mode and frequency should be selected so that the min and max specs of the ADSP-21161N are not exceeded. For more information on clock modes, see the ADSP-21161N DSP Hardware Reference. Table 4-8 shows the jumper setting for the clock modes.\\n\\nTable 4-8: Clock Mode Selections\\n\\n| CLKDBL Pins 1 & 2 | CLK_CFG1 Pins 3 & 4 | CLK_CFG0 Pins 5 & 6 | Core Clock Ratio | EP Clock Ratio |\\n|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|\\n| Not Installed     | Installed           | Installed           | 2:1              | 1x             |\\n| Not Installed     | Installed           | Not Installed       | 3:1              | 1x             |\\n| Not Installed     | Not Installed       | Installed           | 4:1              | 1x             |\\n| Installed         | Installed           | Installed           | 4:1              | 2x             |\\n| Installed         | Installed           | Not Installed       | 6:1              | 2x             |\\n| Installed         | Not Installed       | Installed           | 8:1              | 2x (Default)   |\\n4.3.13 BMS Enable (JP22)\\n\\nJP22 is used to control the routing of the Boot Memory Select (BMS) signal. When the jumper is installed the BMS signal is routed to the FLASH memory interface and can be used for reading, writing and booting. The jumper should be installed when using EPROM boot mode. This jumper should be removed when using the serial boot or no boot mode. If the jumper was left on in these modes the flash would always be selected because the BMS signal is grounded in these modes.\\n\\n4.4 LEDs and Push Buttons\\n\\nThis section describes the function of all the LEDs and push buttons.

What\\u2019s your point?\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Whenever you watch a movie, a commercial or TV show, there always has to be something in it for the audience to enjoy or learn from\\n\\u2022 So, in your essay, or other writing assignments, make sure there is a main point you\\u2019re getting across\\n\\u2022 There must be a reason why you\\u2019re writing in order for there to be a reason why it\\u2019s important for someone to read it\\n\\u2022 Imagine your teacher reading your assignment and wondering, \\u201cSo what? What\\u2019s your point?

Smith\\n\\nDepartment of Entomology, Ohio State University, 318 West 12th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43235, USA\\n\\nNatural olfactory stimuli are often complex and highly variable. The olfactory systems of animals are likely to have evolved to use specific features of olfactory stimuli for identification and discrimination. Here, we train honeybees to learn chemically defined odorant mixtures that systematically vary from trial to trial and then examine how they generalize to each odorant present in the mixture. An odorant that was present at a constant concentration in a mixture becomes more representative of the mixture than other variable odorants. We also show that both variation and intensity of a complex olfactory stimulus affect the rate of generalization by honeybees to subsequent olfactory stimuli. These results have implications for the way that all animals perceive and attend to features of olfactory stimuli.\\n\\nKeywords: olfactory; honeybee; generalization; natural stimulus; odour recognition\\n\\n1. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nOlfactory stimuli are used by animals for many important tasks crucial to their fitness. Naturally occurring olfactory stimuli, such as floral perfumes or animal pheromones, are typically complex and often highly variable combinations of many chemical compounds (Dobson 1994; Laurent 2002; Pichersky & Gershenzon 2002). Each compound in an odor stimulus may differ from the others by several orders of magnitude in concentration (Dobson 1994; Levin et al. 2001). Differences in the ratios of concentration of these compounds can produce distinct perceptual changes that affect odour recognition (Laska & Hudson 1992; Olsson & Cain 2000). Odour recognition is made even more complex by the ephemeral nature of odour mixtures (Crimaldi et al. 2002). Odour stimuli emitted by the same type of 'object' often differ slightly from one encounter to the next, and this variability makes odour objects difficult to classify such that they can be recognized and distinguished.\\n\\nThe olfactory system of an animal must, therefore, form a memory representation for a class of objects, such as the odour of a flower species that presents nectar to a honeybee, which accounts for variability across objects and allows for identification of all objects that mean the same thing. Several behavioural mechanisms have been identified that may be involved in the extraction of features that can be used to classify stimuli. The features that olfactory stimuli have in common, such as the number and types of odorants present and their concentrations, are likely to be important in classifying stimuli (Chandra & Smith 1998; Hosler & Smith 2000; Wise et al. 2000; Laurent 2002; Wiltrout et al. 2003). Specific features that dominate a mixture, however, such as an odorant that is present at a higher concentration than other odorants, could perceptually overshadow other features. In addition, studies of olfactory blocking indicate that olfactory systems of a variety of animals are capable of perceptually isolating individual odorants or submixtures from a blend (Smith 1998; Hosler & Smith 2000; Giannaris et al. 2002) when the individual odorants were more reliably associated with reinforcement than the other odorants present.\\n\\nOur study addresses how variability across experiences with an odor stimulus affects the subsequent identification of odor objects. Trial-to-trial variability could lead to consolidation of an olfactory memory that reflects an average of all experiences of odor stimuli. However, we predicted that the subsequent identification of odor objects, in our case odor mixtures, would reflect features that are most reliably associated with reinforcement. We conditioned honeybees to mixtures of odorants that varied qualitatively from trial to trial as they were reinforced with an appetitive reward, and then tested them with each odorant present in the mixture. Generalization from conditioning with a mixture to each of the test odorants was interpreted as a measure of how similar the test odorant was to the mixture.\\n\\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS\\n\\nWorker honeybees (Apis mellifera) were collected from colonies at the Rothenbuhler Honeybee Laboratory, Columbus, OH, USA. Each subject was placed individually in a restraining harness as described by Smith (1998). All experiments used the proboscis extension response assay to evaluate the olfactory learning behaviour of individual subjects (see Smith (1998) for details). Odour stimuli were delivered by placing 5 \\u00b5l of odour solution on a small strip of filter paper that was then placed in a modified, 1 ml tuberculin glass syringe attached to an air supply and controlled by a solenoid valve (see Smith (1998) for details).\\n\\nOur odour stimuli were mixtures of pure monomolecular odorants at specific molarities created using hexane as a solvent. To examine the effect of qualitative variables on generalization from mixtures to the odorants present, we developed two types of odour mixtures: mixtures composed of perceptually \\u2018similar\\u2019 odorants, and mixtures composed of perceptually \\u2018dissimilar\\u2019 odorants (Stopfer et al. 1997; Laska et al. 1999; Daly & Smith 2000). The similar odours, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol and 1-octanol (Sigma, 99.0% purity), all aliphatic alcohols, differed only with respect to their carbon chain length. The dissimilar odours,\\n1-hexanol, geraniol and 2-octanone (Sigma, 99% + purity) differed with respect to their alkyl groups and carbon chain lengths. All of the similar and dissimilar compounds are volatile, oxygenated hydrocarbons commonly encountered in floral perfumes (Knudsen et al. 1993).\\n\\nTo examine the effect of quantitative variables on generalization, we also varied the concentration of each odorant in the mixture. Individual odorants were presented at one of three possible levels: 0.0002 M (low), 0.02 M (intermediate) and 2.0 M (high). Each concentration was chosen based on its average detectability and discriminability. The low-level odorants were detectable above a solvent background both as conditioning stimuli and as stimuli in an electroantennogram (EAG) assay (Wright & Smith 2004). The high-level odorants were chosen based on their EAG responses relative to the other two odorant levels and the response of the antenna to undiluted odorant (Bhagavan & Smith 1997; Wright & Smith 2004).\\n\\n(a) The contribution of individual odorants\\n\\nThe first experiment was designed to examine if perceptual qualities of mixtures are dominated by the odorants that were reliably associated with reinforcement. In our experiments, this was the odorant present with the least variability in concentration throughout conditioning. To accomplish this, we held one odorant of a mixture at a constant low or high concentration (either 0.0002 M or 2.0 M) while varying the other odorants at either 0.02 M or 2.0 M. In the latter mixture the average concentration of each of the odorants was the odorant present with the least variability in concentration during conditioning. To produce an average concentration with integer levels of odorants in a mixture, our mixture intensities resulted in a range that varied from trial to trial. We used intermediate (0.02 M) and low (0.0002 M) concentrations of each odorant to produce a mean intensity of 0.03 M for the mid-level, and we used intermediate (0.02 M) and high (2.0 M) concentrations to produce a mean intensity of 2.0 M for the high level. We were unable to use the original odorant concentrations to produce a constant mean intensity at the high level with no variation. We therefore chose a concentration of 0.7 M for each odorant. The variable mixtures had a range of 0.0006\\u20130.06 M for the low intensity and 0.02\\u20134.02 M for the high intensity. After acquisition, subjects were tested with the low-level odorants of the mixtures as described in the previous experiment.\\n\\n(c) Statistical analyses\\n\\nFor all of the experiments, the responses of subjects were scored as binary variables, and we used multivariate logistic regression to test all hypotheses (Agresti 1996).\\n\\n3. RESULTS\\n\\nIn all of our experiments, we conditioned subjects to respond to a mixture of three odorants, and we then tested each of the odorants present in the mixture. The rate of generalization to the test odorants was interpreted as a measure of the perceptual similarity between the mixture and the test odorants. Differences in generalization across treatment conditions were interpreted as an index of the way that our experimental conditions affected consolidation of memory for the mixture.\\n\\n(a) A mixture was more similar to a constant odorant than to a variable odorant\\n\\nWe evaluated whether the constant odorant was responded to with a greater probability than the other odorants by comparing the differences in mean response levels to the constant and variable odorants. The result depended on the mixture type (figure 1). For similar mixtures, responses to constant and variable odorants were not significantly different, regardless of whether the subjects had been trained to either the low-constant odorant or the high-constant odorant (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2_1 = 0.60, n = 178, p = 0.434$; figure 1a,c). For the mixtures of dissimilar odorants, the response depended on the level of the constant odor during conditioning and the level of the test odorants (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2_1 = 17.6, n = 226, p < 0.001$; figure 1b,d). Subjects generalized significantly more to the constant odorant than to the variable odorants, except for the condition in which subjects were tested with high levels of odorants after conditioning.\\nwith a low-constant odorant (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 6.91, n = 226, p < 0.01$; figure 1d). In this case, subjects generalized significantly more to the variable odorants.\\n\\nThe control group revealed that the variability in an odorant\\u2019s concentration influenced generalization more than the odorant\\u2019s average intensity. Subjects conditioned to mixtures of similar odorants generalized to each test odorant with equal probability regardless of variability in concentration (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 1.39, n = 42, p = 0.237$; figure 1c). For the mixtures of dissimilar odorants, the response to a constant odorant was greater than the response to the variable odorants (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 4.62, n = 41, p = 0.03$; figure 1f).\\n\\n(b) Constant odorant concentration and mixture type influenced generalization\\n\\nThe average rate of generalization from mixtures to all of the test odorants depended on the difference in the concentration of the constant odorant during initial training and the concentration of the test (figure 1). For example, when tested with low-concentration odorants (figure 1a,b), subjects trained with the constant odorant at the low concentration (shaded bars) responded significantly more than subjects conditioned to mixtures that contained a high-constant odorant (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 7.06, n = 217, p < 0.01$). Furthermore, the average response levels to all of the test odorants were greater for the similar mixtures than for the dissimilar mixtures (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 17.0, n = 217, p < 0.001$).\\n\\nGeneralization to high concentration test odorants increased for both types of odorants, though dissimilar odorants had a lower rate of generalization (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 16.6, n = 187, p < 0.001$; figure 1c,d). Subjects generalized significantly more to a high-constant odorant when conditioned to a mixture that contained a high-constant odorant than when conditioned to a mixture with a constant odorant at a low concentration (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 139, n = 187, p < 0.001$). The opposite pattern was observed for variable odorants.\\n\\n(c) Mixture variability increases generalization to odorants\\n\\nThe average rate of generalization to all the test odorants was a function of mixture intensity and variability in mixture intensity. In all four cases, the variable mixtures had greater rates of generalization to test odorants than constant mixtures (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 59.7, n = 229, p < 0.001$; figure 2). Furthermore, when subjects were conditioned to mid-level (0.03\\u20130.06 M) intensity mixtures, they responded with a greater probability to the test odorants than subjects conditioned with the high-level (2.0\\u20132.1 M) intensity mixtures (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 97.9, n = 229, p < 0.001$).\\nFigure 2. The average response to all the odorants at the low concentration during the test with 0.0002 M odorants (for each group, the leftmost bar is 2.1 M and the rightmost bar is 0.03 M). When subjects were conditioned with high-intensity mixtures (2.0 M and 2.1 M) they responded less than subjects conditioned with low-intensity mixtures (0.03 M and 0.06 M). Subjects conditioned with highly variable mixtures (var) responded with a higher probability than subjects conditioned with no variation present in the mixture (const). The dotted and dashed lines represent the probability of responding to each mixture on the 16th trial of conditioning.\\n\\nThe effect of variability depended on the intensity of the mixture (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 12.6, n = 229, p < 0.001$; figure 2). The increase in generalization from constant to variable mixture treatments was greater at low than at high intensities. Generalization was also slightly higher for dissimilar mixtures (logistic regression: $\\\\chi^2 = 4.86, n = 229, p = 0.028$; figure 2b), but the relative patterns across treatments were the same.\\n\\n4. DISCUSSION\\n\\nOur results indicate that quantitative variation in a complex, olfactory stimulus during conditioning affected generalization to subsequently experienced odours in two ways. First, individual odorants that were at a constant concentration in a mixture became more associated with the mixture\\u2019s identity, whereas variable odorants become less representative. Second, in mixtures where all the odorants were variable, generalization to all subsequent odorant stimuli in the absence of variation are different from the features used to classify novel stimuli. For the conditions in which all the odorants in a mixture varied in concentration, subjects generalized more to the test odorants than subjects who experienced no variation during training. Thus, increasing variation in the stimulus also increased generalization to all subsequent odorant stimuli. These results support the hypothesis that our subjects were generalizing to a class of odour \\u2018objects\\u2019 and that the extent of the generalization was modified by variability in the stimulus. We show that the features used to classify odour stimuli in the absence of variation are different from the features used to classify stimuli when variability is present.\\n\\nDifferences in generalization from the conditioning to the test odorants in our study may also have arisen due to the type of odorants present in the mixtures. Subjects conditioned to similar mixtures had higher mean rates of generalization than mixtures of dissimilar odorants, and they showed equal generalization to all of the odorants regardless of the level of variability in concentration. This may have occurred because the odorants present in the similar mixtures were perceptually similar and therefore more difficult for bees to differentiate (Stopfer et al. 1997; Laska et al. 1999). Each odorant may have appeared less variable, causing the effects of variability in the similar mixtures to be dampened.\\n\\n(b) Variation increases generalization\\n\\nTheories of generalization propose that animals must generalize from a specific instance to subsequent experiences because no two presentations of stimuli can be exactly alike (Pavlov 1927; Kalish 1970; Shepard 1987; Pearce 1994). From a behavioural standpoint, generalization arises from two different mechanisms. First, animals might generalize across stimuli that they can easily discriminate because they have experienced the same reinforcement for each stimulus (Shepard 1987; Pearce 2002). Second, generalization could also arise from a failure of the sensory system to distinguish among stimuli (Shepard 1987; Pearce 1994).\\n\\nWhen generalization occurs to different stimuli that have been classified together according to their common association with reinforcement (Kalish 1970; Shepard 1987), features that are common to the reinforced stimuli are used to classify novel stimuli. For the conditions in which all the odorants in a mixture varied in concentration, subjects generalized more to the test odorants than subjects who experienced no variation during training. Thus, increasing variation in the stimulus also increased generalization to all subsequent odorant stimuli. These results support the hypothesis that our subjects were generalizing to a class of odour \\u2018objects\\u2019 and that the extent of the generalization was modified by variability in the stimulus. We show that the features used to classify odour stimuli in the absence of variation are different from the features used to classify stimuli when variability is present.\\n\\nA constant odour influences odour object classification\\n\\nWhen a subject experienced an odour mixture in our experiments, what it learned about the odour was affected by quantitative variation in each of the odorants present in the mixture during conditioning. We hypothesize that the increase in the contribution of the constant odorant to a mixture\\u2019s identity was a function of its more reliable association with reinforcement. Blocking protocols have also demonstrated that the odorants present in a mixture, which are the most reliably associated with reinforcement, gain salience over the other odorants present (Smith 1998; Hosler & Smith 2000). Blocking has been shown to occur when an odorant with a pre-conditioned association with reinforcement is experienced subsequently in a binary mixture. The pre-conditioned odorant often overshadows the presence of another odorant such that the latter is not learned as well as it would have been if no pre-conditioning had taken place (Rescorla & Holland 1982; Rescorla 1988; Pearce 1994). The increase in salience of the pre-conditioned odorant is hypothesized to be mediated by lateral inhibition in the olfactory bulb or antennal lobe, the first synaptic relay for sensory input from the olfactory receptor neurons (Linster & Smith 1997; Urban 2002).\\n\\nProc. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004)\\n(c) Stimulus intensity modulates the effect of variability\\n\\nFurthermore, a subject\\u2019s ability to generalize to low-level odorants was also affected by the intensity of the stimulus during training. If subjects had been trained to a high-intensity stimulus, their response to the low-concentration test odorants significantly decreased. This change in sensitivity from high to low could be facilitated by either of two mechanisms: adaptive gain control or adaptation of the neurons in the antennae and/or antennal lobe.\\n\\nAdaptive gain control adapts a sensory system to variability in a stimulus by amplifying the stimulus in inverse proportion to its range of intensity (Fairhall et al. 2001). When the range is narrow, the sensory system broadens the intensity-response function to carry as much information as possible about the stimulus within that range. In our study, this mechanism could be tuning the olfactory system to odorants that are present at a specific concentration dependent upon the subject\\u2019s exposure to olfactory stimuli of a given intensity and the level of variability present during conditioning.\\n\\nAlternatively, adaptation of the neurons of the antennal lobe would also change the sensitivity of the olfactory system (Potter & Chorover 1976; Mair 1982; Devaud et al. 2001). If the neurons in the antennal lobe were adapted, exposure to high-intensity stimuli would change the response range such that the olfactory system would respond only to high-intensity stimuli and not to low-intensity stimuli. Adaptation, however, could not account for the change in the response due to the variability of the conditioning stimulus. Which of these two mechanisms caused a reduction in the response to low-concentration odorants after conditioning with high-intensity stimuli remains unclear from our data.\\n\\n5. CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nQuantitative variation of the odorants present in an olfactory stimulus affects how animals form olfactory memories. Decreasing the variation of an individual odorant in an odor mixture causes it to gain salience; increasing the variation in all the odorants produces greater generalization. These results indicate that consolidated odor memory depends on variation in stimuli across experiences. This odor memory does not simply reflect experiences. This odour memory does not simply reflect variation in stimuli across experiences. This odour memory does not simply reflect variation in stimuli across experiences. This odour memory does not simply reflect variation in stimuli across experiences. This odour memory does not simply reflect variation in stimuli across experiences.\\n\\nThe authors dedicate this article to R. Shepard whose work has inspired their studies of generalization.

Introduction\\n\\nAs everyone knows, it is almost impossible to achieve any fluency in a foreign language without conversational practice: the most effective way to pick up a language is to spend time in a country where it is spoken, or, failing that, to talk regularly with a native speaker. Unfortunately, neither of these options are available for many language students. It is consequently interesting to explore techniques for creating automatic conversation partners. There is a continuum here with respect to the degree of free variation permitted on the student\\u2019s part. At one extreme, which represents current commercial mainstream systems like TellMeMore and RosettaStone\\u00b9, we have \\u201cclosed-response\\u201d systems [1]. The system indicates to the student precisely what they are supposed to say; the student repeats it, and is then graded on their pronunciation. Though undoubtedly useful, this is less than ideal. As pointed out in [2], effective systems for language learning need to allow the learner to produce large quantities of sentences on their own, something that is, by definition, impossible to realise in a closed response application.\\n\\nAt the other extreme, one can try to build a fully interactive system, which carries out a genuine conversation with the student in some kind of simulated environment; a high-profile example is TICTS [3]. It is, however, extremely challenging to make a system of this kind adequately robust, and in particular to implement sufficiently powerful language understanding. The system we describe here, CALL-SLT [4], explores an intermediate solution. This has its roots in the \\u201ctranslation game\\u201d idea of Wang and Seneff [5], who successfully reused speech and language technology developed at MIT under other projects [6] to build a speech-enabled game for students who wished to practise Chinese. In their game, the system shows English sentences to the student, who has to respond with a spoken Chinese translation. The system matches the student response against the original prompt, and produces informative feedback. Most of the subjects who participated in the initial study were positive about the system.\\n\\nCALL-SLT uses a similar basic strategy, though many of the details are different; in particular, we use another approach to speech recognition, present prompts to the student in a more principled way, and include a help system which allows students to share experience across languages. In Section 2, we briefly present more background on the system. The rest of the paper describes new enhancements not described in previous publications, which make it possible to organise the corpus of examples used by the system as a set of structured lessons, each one organised around a specified syntactic or semantic theme. We present the \\u201clesson structure\\u201d framework and outline the initial sets of lessons we have built for the English, French and Japanese versions of CALL-SLT.\\n\\n2. The CALL-SLT System\\n\\nCALL-SLT is an Open Source speech-based CALL application for beginning to intermediate-level language students who wish to improve their spoken fluency. The system runs on a medium-range Windows laptop; it can also be deployed on a mobile platform, using the client/server architecture described in [7], with performance identical to that of the laptop version. The current version uses a restaurant domain, and supports English, French, Japanese, Swedish, Arabic and German as L1s, with English or French as the L2. Vocabulary varies from around 150 to around 500 words per language, and covers basic situations such as reserving a table, ordering food and drink, asking for the bill, and so on. Table 1 shows a typical example of coverage.\\n\\nCALL-SLT leverages earlier work on Regulus, a platform for building systems based on grammatical-based speech understanding [8] and MedSLT, an interlingua-based speech translation framework [9, 10], to develop a generic CALL platform centered on the \\u201cspoken translation game\\u201d idea. Our initial experiences, including an extensive test carried out on several hundred Swiss high-school students [4], have demonstrated that the Regulus/MedSLT architecture is a good fit to this type of ap-\\n\\n\\u00b9tellmemore.com; rosettastone.com.\\n\\n\\u00b2Versions with Japanese 1.1 and Greek 1.2 are in preparation.\\n| English     | French                                | Japanese                     |\\n|-------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|\\n| I would like a mint tea | J\\u2019ai d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 une bi\\u00e8re (Could I have a beer) | Biru nihai onegai shi masu (I would like two beers) |\\n| A tea and a coffee please | J\\u2019aimerais de fromage r\\u00e2pe (I would like some grated cheese) | Madagura no seki waraimasu ka (Is there a table by the window) |\\n| Do you have a table for four people | Je voudrais une table dans le coin (I would like a table in the corner) | Betabetsu ni hakumasho ka (Can we pay separately) |\\n| Could I reserve a table for seven thirty | Est-ce que je pourrais voir le menu (Could I see the menu) | Hachii jee han karu futari no teiburu wo yoyakai shiita no dewa ga (I would like to reserve a table for two people for half past eight) |\\n\\nTable 1: Examples of CALL-SLT coverage in the restaurant domain, for English, French and Japanese.\\n\\nIn particular, the grammar-based approach to recognition gives a response profile with accurate recognition on in-grammar utterances and poor or no recognition on out-of-grammar utterances, automatically giving the student feedback on the correctness of their language usage. Also, the platform\\u2019s rapid development facilities, based on semi-automatic specialisation of general resource grammars, have made it easy to create good speech recognisers for our initial domain (a tourist restaurant scenario), despite the very limited availability of training data. Although the recognisers for the various J2 languages are all built from development corpora of at most a few hundred examples, native speakers typically get per-sentence semantic error rates of under 10%.\\n\\nTwo other differences between CALL-SLT and the MIT system are also worth highlighting. First, one of the main weaknesses of Wang\\u2019s and Snieff\\u2019s work is that prompts are in the student\\u2019s own language (the J1). This has the undesirable effect of tying the language being studied (the J2) too closely to the J1 in the student\\u2019s mind, and is quite contrary to mainstream theories of language acquisition. Instead of prompting students with sentences in the J1, our system shows them interlingua representations; these are created using semantic grammars based on our previous work on human-readable representations of interlingua [11].\\n\\nSecond, instead of focussing on a single language pair, we think of the problem more broadly as an activity in the multilingual language learning community. We structure learning activities so as to encourage students to contribute data both in the J1 and in the J2. Each student\\u2019s recorded native speaker data is used as a resource to help other students studying that language, or the graphical prompt shown in Figure 1. In both cases, an appropriate response would be something like \\u201cCould I have the soup?\\u201d, \\u201cI would like some soup\\u201d, or simply \\u201cSoup, please\\u201d; the grammar supports most of the normal ways to formulate this type of request.\\n\\nThe student decides what she is going to say, presses the \\u201crecognise\\u201d button, and speaks. The system performs speech recognition using a Nuance 8.5 recognition package3 compiled from a grammar-based language model, translates the result into the interlingua, matches it against the underlying interlingua representation of the prompt, gives the student feedback on the match, and adjusts the level of difficulty up or down. If the match was successful, the student\\u2019s recorded speech is also saved for future use.\\n\\nThe student may ask for help at any time. The system can give help either in speech or text form. Text help examples are taken from the original corpus, and can also be produced by translating from the interlingua back into the J1; speech help examples are created by recording successful interactions, or by doing TTS on text examples.\\n\\n3. Constructing language courses in CALL-SLT\\n\\nA frequent comment from early users of CALL-SLT has been that the system would be more useful if it included structured language exercises. Over the last few months, we have extended\\n\\n![Figure 1: Mobile version of the CALL-SLT system, running on a Nokia tablet and using the graphical interlingua. The pictorial string is the graphical prompt, which here represents \\u201cAsk politely for soup\\u201d. The buttons on the right are, from top to bottom, \\u201crecognise\\u201d, \\u201cnext prompt\\u201d and \\u201chelp\\u201d.](image-url)\\nthe platform to include a framework to support this type of functionality. The basic idea is simple: we allow the course designer to divide up the set of examples into a number of possibly overlapping subsets, each one defined by a list of syntactic and semantic criteria. We call a grouping of this kind a lesson. At runtime, the student sees a menu of available lessons, and is able to navigate between them using a menu. Each lesson is associated with a page of explanation, which covers the topic or topics that it introduces.\\n\\nInitially, we had planned to define the content of lessons in terms of semantic properties: for example, we might have a lesson that focused on time expressions, or on numbers. A strategy of this kind can easily be implemented by defining constraints on the interlingual representations associated with the examples. This strategy did indeed seem appropriate for languages like English and Japanese, which have relatively simple syntax. French syntax, however, is considerably more challenging, with concepts like grammatical gender, agreement and verb inflection playing a crucial role; it also turned out to be useful to have the option of including lexical constraints.\\n\\nAlthough this complicated the architecture of the system, we decided to allow lesson content to be defined using any Boolean combination of semantic, syntactic and lexical constraints. A lexical constraint is implemented simply as a requirement that a specific sequence of words should be present in the surface string; similarly, a semantic constraint is a requirement that a given, possibly partially instantiated, structure should match some part of the interlingual representation.\\n\\nThe least trivial question was how to permit definition of syntactic constraints. After some experimentation, we decided that we could implement a sufficiently expressive framework by defining a syntactic constraint $S$ to be a partially instantiated syntactic category $C_S$. We parse each example $E$ using the feature grammar which forms the basis for the recognizer's language model (cf. [8]), and extract all the syntactic categories $C(E)$ from the analysis tree. We then say that $E$ has syntactic property $S$ if there is at least one $C(E)$ which unifies with $C_S$.\\n\\nIn the French version, the framework lets us define constraints like \\\"uses inverted word order\\\", \\\"includes an adjective\\\" or \\\"includes a verb in infinitive form\\\"; for example, the first of these constraints is coded as a match against the syntactic category vp: [inv-inverted]. Similarly, in the Japanese version, we can define constraints like \\\"includes a counter\\\" or \\\"uses the plain form of a verb\\\".\\n\\nAt system build time, each help example is analysed to determine the set of lessons it matches, as follows. Recalled spoken help examples are first replaced by their transcripts, and the text form of the example is parsed to produce an analysis tree and a semantic representation. Syntactic categories are then extracted from each parse tree; while the semantic representation is converted into interlingual form. Finally, the set of syntactic and semantic constraints associated with each lesson is matched against the extracted information, and the result is cached.\\n\\nIt is important that the help system only offers help appropriate to the current lesson, since there will in general be multiple help examples for any given prompt. For example, suppose in the French version that the prompt is\\n\\nORDER POLITELY SOUP\\n\\nIn an early lesson, where the theme is to learn to ask for things in as simple a way as possible and practice using singular nouns, the help example might be a recording of je voudrais la soupe (\\\"I would like the soup\\\"). In a later lesson, where the theme is making requests using questions, the help example might be Puis-je avoir la soupe? (\\\"Could I have the soup?\\\"). Similar considerations apply in Japanese. In an early lesson, a help example for something like\\n\\nASK FOR POLITELY TABLE 2 PERSON\\n\\nwill be formed using the basic request con structure onegal shimasu, while in a later one it might use the more formal ga animasu ka or... tai no desu ga.\\n\\nAn interesting point arises when the user response is semantically correct, but fails to obey the constraints associated with the current lesson. Continuing the French example immediately above, suppose that the lesson is \\\"simple requests using singular nouns\\\", and the student is given the prompt above. If she replies Puis-je avoir la soupe?, her response is semantically correct (it will produce the correct interlingua), but it fails to match the current syntactic constraints. We considered the idea of warning the student in these circumstances, but this strategy seems in practice overly strict; our observation is that it can confuse students, particularly when it is inappropriately applied due to a recognition error. In the current version of the system, students are allowed to respond using any valid syntactic form, irrespective of whether or not it conforms to the theme of the lesson.\\n\\n3.1. Initial lesson structures\\n\\nWe have implemented initial sets of lessons for English, French and Japanese. As already noted, the very different structures of these three languages mean that the lesson structure differs significantly from language to language. English and Japanese have relatively simple grammars, and this is reflected in an arrangement primarily organised according to semantic/pragmatic considerations. The English version of the system currently has five lessons, as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nlesson([\\\"lesson_id=singular_nouns,\\n    constraints=[request=yes,\\n                   fr_singular_noun=yes,\\n                   fr_adjunctive=no,\\n                   fr_voulaire_only=yes,\\n                   fr_infinitive=no,\\n                   fr_time=no,\\n                   food_and_drink=yes,\\n                   french_number=no,\\n                   de=no,\\n                   de-no],\\n    help_file='sing_nouns_help.txt')\\n\\nlesson([\\\"lesson_id=times,\\n    constraints=[request=yes,\\n                   fr_time=yes,\\n                   fr_inf_libre=yes,\\n                   person=no,\\n                   french_loc=not],\\n    help_file='time_help.txt')\\n```\\n\\nFigure 2: Two examples of French lesson definitions. The format has been slightly simplified for expository reasons.\\n\\nwill be formed using the basic request construction onegal shimasu, while in a later one it might use the more formal ga animasu ka or... tai no desu ga.\\n\\nAn interesting point arises when the user response is semantically correct, but fails to obey the constraints associated with the current lesson. Continuing the French example immediately above, suppose that the lesson is \\\"simple requests using singular nouns\\\", and the student is given the prompt above. If she replies Puis-je avoir la soupe?, her response is semantically correct (it will produce the correct interlingua), but it fails to match the current syntactic constraints. We considered the idea of warning the student in these circumstances, but this strategy seems in practice overly strict; our observation is that it can confuse students, particularly when it is inappropriately applied due to a recognition error. In the current version of the system, students are allowed to respond using any valid syntactic form, irrespective of whether or not it conforms to the theme of the lesson.\\n\\n3.1. Initial lesson structures\\n\\nWe have implemented initial sets of lessons for English, French and Japanese. As already noted, the very different structures of these three languages mean that the lesson structure differs significantly from language to language. English and Japanese have relatively simple grammars, and this is reflected in an arrangement primarily organised according to semantic/pragmatic considerations. The English version of the system currently has five lessons, as follows:\\n1. Greetings and politeness (\\\"hello\\\", \\\"good evening\\\", \\\"thank you\\\", etc).\\n2. Asking for things (\\\"I would like\\\" + a noun phrase)\\n3. Asking for things using questions (\\\"Could I have/do you have\\\" + a noun phrase)\\n4. Numbers (\\\"I would like two beers/ a table for three people/etc\\\")\\n5. Times (\\\"I would like a table for six o'clock/half past six/quarter to seven/nineteen hundred/etc\\\")\\n\\nThe set of Japanese lessons is similar to the English one. Syntax, however, plays a larger role in French; although we still have lessons based on themes similar to those in the English and Japanese systems, several more are organized explicitly around syntactic issues:\\n\\n1. Singular nouns. Simple requests involving only singular nouns, e.g. Je voudrais le lapin (\\\"I would-like the rabbit\\\").\\n2. Plural nouns. Requests involving plural nouns and the future tense, e.g. Je prendrais les fraises (\\\"I will-take the strawberries\\\").\\n3. Compound nominals. Noun phrases with de or \\u00e0, e.g. Je prendrais les fruits de mer (\\\"I will-take the seafood\\\").\\n4. Adjectives. French adjectives agree in number and gender, e.g. Je voudrais un steak bien cuit (\\\"I would-like a-MASC steak-MASC well-done-MASC\\\")\\n5. Requests using questions. More complex ways to phrase requests, e.g. Avez-vous une bi\\u00e8re? (\\\"Might we have a beer?\\\") or Quels vins recommandez-vous? (\\\"What wines do you recommend?\\\")\\n6. Infinitives. Requests using the infinitive form, e.g. Puis-je avoir une bi\\u00e8re? (\\\"Can I have-INF a beer?\\\")\\n\\nFigure 2 shows examples of two French lesson definitions, for singular nouns and times respectively. The first is intended to be done early in the course, so most non-trivial constructions are blocked; the second is intended to be done near the end, so most constructions are allowed.\\n\\n4. Summary and further directions\\n\\nWe have presented an overview of the CALL-SLT translation game/conversation partner, focussing on recent work where we have introduced a framework that permits the instructor to divide up material into a structured set of lessons. We have only just begun to experiment with this new functionality, and it is still very much under development. It is, unfortunately, not at all easy to evaluate CALL systems in a fully objective way [12]; the question we really wish to address is whether they help students learn, and this requires an elaborate methodology where a group using the system is contrasted against a similar one that is not doing so. We are currently working on an Internet-enabled version of CALL-SLT, which we expect to have operational by Q3 2010. This should make it much easier to perform evaluation experiments.\\n\\nIt is likely that we will by then also have elaborated the currently very simple lesson structure framework. At a minimum, we will certainly have extended the existing set of lessons, and implemented lesson plans for some of the other CALL-SLT languages, in particular German and Arabic. We are also considering experimenting with some more ambitious ideas; a particularly interesting one is to provide the student with an interface that allows them to define their own lessons, so that they can create a specific topic or set of topics, while excluding others. We will report on further progress at the workshop, where we will also be able to demonstrate the system.\\n\\n5. References\\n\\n[1] F. Ehsani and E.

Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation (tilting) experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observations of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nPlants are living organisms that have long been observed to adaptively regulate their shape and movement in order to optimize their physical performance. The best-known example of an adaptive plant response is phototropism, which describes the ability of plants to track sunlight in order to maximize photosynthesis. While phototropism often results in plants growing upwards toward the sun, it is not the only mechanism by which plants can achieve upward orientation and growth. In fact, many plants exhibit gravitropism and can spatially orient their organs with the gravitational field [1, 2], yielding roots that grow downward in direction of...\\ngravity and stems elongating upwards counter to gravitational pull. In organs undergoing primary growth, gravitropism, phototropism, and other plant tropisms result from an asymmetrical distribution of auxin in the elongation zone of these organs [2\\u20134]. The unequal distribution of auxin in growth regions causes a difference in growth rate between opposite sides of the plant organ, resulting in a curvature (Fig 1) that orients the plant organ toward a salient stimulus [3, 5\\u20137].\\n\\nStudies on the kinematics of gravitropic movement in plants have largely neglected the aerial organs, instead focusing on roots as they are less affected by phototropism [10\\u201312]. In roots, graviception occurs only in the root cap, which transmits a growth signal to the underlying elongation zone. Consequently, the regulation of the movement is limited to the apical part [13].\\n\\nIn contrast to roots, both perception and movement regulation are possible along the entire length of the aerial stem [5, 13, 14]. Because they are not embedded within a substrate, unlike\\n\\n![Fig 1. Straightening movement of a wheat coleoptile, in the standard reading direction. The white line is a 10 mm reference.

In order to consistently grow straight upwards, aerial organs must exhibit both graviception and proprioception, the ability of plants to perceive their own shape and respond accordingly [2, 14, 15]. These two perceptions have different effects on plant movement and shape: graviception tends to increase the curvature of the organ and enable it to reach vertical, while proprioception causes plants to modify their growth in order to remain straight [14]. Aerial organs must, therefore, balance the effects of graviception and proprioception in order to successfully grow upwards against the force of gravity. For these reasons, studying gravitropism in plant aerial organs provides a unique opportunity to understand the how plants integrate multi-sensory information and regulate adaptive growth and movement.\\n\\nRecently, the process of gravitropic movement in plant aerial organs has been formalized in a unifying model called the \\u201cAC model\\u201d [5, 14], where the dynamics are expressed through the additive (but opposing) effects of graviception and proprioception. Comparison with experimental data demonstrated that this model is able to explain the complex kinematics of gravitropism in at least eleven species covering a broad taxonomic range of angiosperms, habitats, and aerial organ types, suggesting that it captures a fundamental regulatory process of plant tropism [5, 14]. However, many plants seem to present a more comprehensive regulation of gravitropic movement that current described by the AC model. In particular, this model tends to overestimate the likelihood that aerial organs will \\u201covershoot\\u201d the vertical. One reason for the failure to include this additional regulatory behavior in the AC model may be that this regulatory mechanism can not be properly observed without clear and complete observations of plant movement, and a complete plant kinematics analysis is often not quantified or reported. Measurements of plant movement that focus on the first instants of the gravitropic reaction [16\\u201318], or restrict analysis to the movement of the apical tip alone [17\\u201319], give an incomplete picture of the kinematics of gravitropic movement and are insufficient for understanding its regulation [3, 13, 14, 20].\\n\\nTo discover the additional movement regulations that prevent plants from overshooting the vertical, we recorded the complete kinematics of wheat (Triticum aestivum) coleoptiles during a gravitropic experimental study. Wheat coleoptiles were chosen as our model system because they can be grown in absence of light, eliminating the concern of phototropic effects. Additionally, it has been observed that they rarely overshoot the vertical [5], making them likely candidates for detecting a mechanism that prevents overshoots. After allowing seeds of wheat to germinate in a vertical position until they matured into coleoptiles, individual plants were subjected to one of two spatial reorientation conditions: no spatial reorientation (vertical) or 90\\u00b0 reorientation (horizontal). Their movements were then observed for 24 hours.\\n\\nThroughout the observation period we recorded and quantified the growth and structure of the entire coleoptile with KymoRod, a new tool developed to extract the complete kinematics of an aerial organ in movement [21]. Using this approach, we compared the kinematics of disturbed and undisturbed coleoptiles in order to discover the mechanism responsible for the regulation of gravitropic movement beyond what is included in the AC model. As these dynamics are not yet described or defined in the current formulation of the AC model, we further seek to do so here.\\n\\n**Materials and methods**\\n\\n**Coleoptile preparation and general methods**\\n\\nSeeds of recital wheat (Triticum aestivum) were immersed in water for 6 hours to initiate germination, then each seed was attached to a plastic test tube filled with cotton and water.\\nBecause wheat coleoptiles do not sprout vertically from the seed\\u2019s longitudinal axis, all seeds were adhered at a 45\\u02da angle to ensure that coleoptiles would grow vertically with minimal initial curvature. After being attached to test tubes, all seeds were put in a darkroom to germinate for 3 to 4 days until coleoptiles were 10\\u201320 mm long. Each coleoptile was then dusted with an orange, non-toxic, fluorescent dry painting pigment (Sennelier 648), leaving \\\"tracer\\\" particles on the coleoptile surface that were later used for extracting kinematics (Fig 2).\\n\\nPrepared coleoptiles were transferred to an experimental darkroom, positioned 80 cm in front of a camera (Olympus SP-550UZ or SP-560UZ), and oriented in profile to the camera lens such that maximum curvature was recorded and no part of the coleoptile structure was obscured by the seed. Photographs were taken every 15 minutes during a 24 hours period, with the camera\\u2019s flashlight covered by a \\u201csafe\\u201d green light filter (Lee 139 Primary Green). Preliminary experiments showed that neither the pigment markers nor the flash altered any aspects of coleoptile movement and growth.\\n\\n**Experimental procedure**\\n\\nEach coleoptile was randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. In the tilted group, immediately prior to recording, coleoptiles were reoriented from the vertical at a 90\\u02da angle (horizontal) and kept in that position for the duration of the experiment. Coleoptiles assigned to the straight (untitled) group were remained vertical, aligned with the direction of the the gravity field. This second group served as a control to monitor how the aerial organ would grow without gravitropic perturbation.\\nMorphometric balance number\\n\\nIn the AC model, the dynamics of aerial stem movement are represented by a unique dimensionless number, $B$ the \\\"balance number\\\"\\n\\n$$B = \\\\frac{\\\\beta L_{\\\\text{eff}}}{\\\\gamma}$$\\n\\nwhere $L_{\\\\text{eff}}$ is the effective length of the organ. If the length of the organ $L$ is less than the length of the growth zone ($L_{gz} > L$) at the time before stimulation $L(t = 0)$, then $L_{\\\\text{eff}} = L$. In contrast, if ($L_{gz} < L$) at $L(t = 0)$, then $L_{\\\\text{eff}} = \\\\frac{L}{\\\\sin \\\\theta}$ (see Fig 3 for a full visual depiction). The number $B$ expresses the ratio between graviception, $\\\\beta$, and proprioception $\\\\gamma$, scaled to the length of the organ that can move.\\n\\nExtracting coleoptile kinematics\\n\\nFor each coleoptile, the KymoRod software [21] was used to extract movement kinematics from the images recorded during the experiment. From every image taken at time $t$, KymoRod extracted the total length of the coleoptile organ $L(t)$, and determined each position $s$ along the length of the organ from base to apex. For each position $s$, the organ\\u2019s orientation from the vertical $A(s, t)$ was computed in radians (see Fig 3).\\n\\nThe curvature of the organ $C(s, t)$ was then calculated with a spatial derivation of the organ\\u2019s orientation from vertical as shown:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{\\\\partial A(s, t)}{\\\\partial s} = C(s, t)$$\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nTo fully describe the kinematics, the curvature variation $\\\\frac{DC(s, t)}{Dt}$ was computed in order to account for organ deformation and elongation [2, 3, 5]. $\\\\frac{DC(s, t)}{Dt}$ was calculated using the material\\nderivative $\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}$ co-moving with each element of the organ derivative. The material derivative of the local variable $C(s, t)$ is therefore given by:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{DC(s,t)}{Dt} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial C(s,t)}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial C(s,t)}{\\\\partial s} \\\\int_0^s E(s', t) ds'$$\\n\\nwhere the sign of $\\\\frac{DC(s,t)}{Dt}$ describes the direction of curvature relative to the vertical and $E(s, t)$ is the relative elongation growth rate (REGR) in the direction of the main axis of the organ. $E(s, t)$ was determined using subpixel displacement mapping function based on digital image correlation [21] which works by comparing target features from sets of digital images. At each position $s$ along the length of the organ, we quantified REGR by applying a focal moving window that identified unique patterns of fluorescent markers and assessed marker displacement over time by comparing corresponding windows from sequential images. To yield a single value of elongation growth and curvature variation per coleoptile, we calculated the temporal averages of $E(s, t)$ and $\\\\frac{DC(s,t)}{Dt}$ based on the absolute values of the entire set of kinematic extracted from each coleoptile. To compare between the dynamics just after gravitropic perturbation and after the plant has reached some potential gravitropic equilibrium, those values are compared before and after an ad-hoc time of 12 hours.\\n\\n**Calculating the balance number $B$**\\n\\nFor all coleoptiles in the tilted condition, the balance number $B$ was extracted through morphometric measurement as detailed in [14],\\n\\n$$B = \\\\frac{L_{eff}}{L_c}$$\\n\\nwhere $B$ represents the ratio between the effective length of the growth zone $L_{eff}$ and the length of the curved zone $L_c$ at the end of the experiment when no variation of curvature is observed $\\\\frac{DC(s,t)}{Dt} = 0$. By calculating $B$ based on initial morphometrics, we predicted which coleoptiles would ultimately overshoot the vertical. We demonstrated that plants with $B > 2.8$ should display an overshoot during the gravitropic movement [14]. Because $B$ is a measure of the gravitropic movement, it cannot be calculated for coleoptiles in the straight and vertical condition.\\n\\n**Characterizing oscillations**\\n\\nThe relative elongation growth rate $E(s, t)$ and the curvature variation $\\\\frac{DC(s,t)}{Dt}$ were represented on spatiotemporal kymographs. Thresholding was used to identify the positions of oscillation maxima and minima. The oscillation period $T_p$ was defined as the time $T$ between $n$ non-successive peaks (maxima) as shown in:\\n\\n$$T_p = \\\\frac{T}{n}$$\\n\\nThe velocity of these oscillation \\\"pulses\\\" was determined by first fitting a line that followed the position of each oscillation maximum (Fig 4). We consider that the position, $P_{\\\\theta}(t)$, of a local maxima traveling along the organ, starting at $t = t_0$ for $s = 0$, can be described by a linear equation\\n\\n$$P_{\\\\theta}(t) = v_p(t - t_0)$$\\nThe pulse velocity is then given by\\n\\n\\\\[ v_p = \\\\frac{P_B(t)}{t + t_0} \\\\] (7)\\n\\nData analysis\\n\\nAll statistical and image analyses were conducted in MATLAB (v. 9.0 R2016a, Mathworks Inc.). After calculating the balance number \\\\( B \\\\) for each coleoptile in the tilted group, we compared overshoot model predictions [14] to actual experimental data using Fisher\\u2019s Exact test to quantify if the model was accurately able to predict coleoptile overshoot. We tested for differences between coleoptiles in the tilted and straight experimental treatments using Mann-Whitney U tests (non-parametric Student t-tests) and compared: the oscillatory periods, velocity of oscillatory pulses, and temporal averages, of both elongation growth rate \\\\( \\\\dot{E}(s, t) \\\\) and curvature variation \\\\( \\\\frac{DC(s, t)}{Dt} \\\\). To uncover if oscillations in elongation growth and curvature variation were somehow related, and if this relationship depended on tilting treatment, we calculated the image correlation statistic \\\\( r \\\\) between these two oscillation kymographs for each coleoptile. We then compared the distributions of \\\\( r \\\\) from coleoptiles in the straight and tilted treatments with a Mann Whitney U tests. Movies of all plants analyzed are available online [22, 23].\\n\\nResults\\n\\nFull movement dynamics were extracted from 62 coleoptiles in the straight condition, and 54 coleoptiles in the tilted condition. The unequal sample size is due to several coleoptiles\\nbecoming \\u201cpierced\\u201d by the plan\\u2019s initial leaf within the recording time-frame of the experiment (see [8, 9]). As the piercing stops any movement and growth dynamics of the coleoptile, data from these individuals was discarded.\\n\\n**Description of movement patterns**\\n\\nThe straightening movement of a tilted wheat coleoptile follows the generic pattern of gravitropic movement previously formalized in the AC model [14]. After being tilted, the coleoptile initially responds by curving the entire aerial organ towards the vertical. Once the tip or apex of the coleoptile has reached the vertical, a process that take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours, the curvature concentrates near the base of the aerial organ while the remainder of the coleoptile continues to elongate along the vertical (Fig 5).\\n\\n**Growth regulation in wheat coleoptiles exceeds AC model predictions**\\n\\nFewer tilted coleoptiles overshot the vertical during our experiment ($n_{\\\\text{observed}} = 5$) than predicted by the AC model ($n_{\\\\text{predicted}} = 16$), both during responsive movement and in their final shape (Fig 6). Our Fisher\\u2019s Exact test revealed that the difference between predicted and actual overshoots was significant ($n = 54$, $df = 1$, $p = 0.0069$, $OddsRatio = 4.12$, 95% CI $[0.99, 17.28]$).\\n\\n![Fig 5.

Straight = $1.0 \\\\times 10^{-5} \\\\, s^{-1}$, Med. Tilted = $9.3 \\\\times 10^{-6} \\\\, s^{-1}$, $U = 2896$, $p = 0.019$) (Fig 7). As evidenced by the kymographs shown in Fig 8, elongation growth rate showed a pattern of oscillation, with growth peaks passing through the aerial organ in waves. However, there was no difference in the average duration (period) of oscillations (Med. Straight = 2.9h, Med. Tilted = 2.8h, $U = 1084$, $p = 0.88$) and no difference in the velocity of oscillation pulses along the length of the plant organ (Med. Straight = 11.3mm/s, Med. Tilted = 12.3mm/s, $U = 2.64 \\\\times 10^4$, $p = 0.12$) between the straight and tilted coleoptile groups.\\n\\nWhole-plant kinematics: Change in curvature\\n\\nWhen measured up to 12h after stimulation, tilted coleoptiles had a significantly greater average absolute curvature variation than straight coleoptiles ($U = 11082$, $p = 3.2 \\\\times 10^{-4}$). Inside the growth zone, the magnitude of curvature variation is $2.56 \\\\pm .04$ times greater in tiled\\ncoleoptiles compared to straight coleoptiles. However, after 12 hours, straight and tilted coleoptiles show similar absolute curvature distributions ($U = 10327, p = 0.09$) (Fig 9). Oscillation patterns were also present in kymographs of curvature variation (Fig 8). Between coleoptiles from the straight and tilted groups there were significant differences in oscillation period (Med. Straight = 2.8h, Med. Tilted = 3.0h, $U = 3709, p = 0.038$) and in the velocity of these pulses (Med. Straight = 14.1mm.s$^{-1}$, Med. Tilted = 16.6mm.s$^{-1}$, $U = 144624, p < 0.001$), with tilted coleoptiles demonstrating oscillations that were shorter and travelled more slowly along the aerial organ.\\n\\n**Tilted coleoptiles show correlated waves of elongation growth and curvature change**\\n\\nTo uncover if oscillations in elongation growth and curvature variation were somehow related, and if this relationship depended on tilting treatment, we calculated the image correlation statistic $r$ between these two oscillation kymographs for each coleoptile used in the study. While coleoptiles in the straight treatment showed no evidence of a relationship between oscillations in elongation growth rate and curvature variation on average, tilted coleoptiles demonstrated a significant relationship between the two oscillatory manifestations (Med. Straight = \\u22120.026,\\nThe relationship is described by the data as a moderately strong and negative, indicating an asynchronous regulatory mechanism that causes the oscillations of elongation growth and curvature variation to be shifted and slightly out of phase.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nIn our sample of tilted coleoptiles, fewer coleoptiles over shot the vertical than predicted (Fig 4), suggesting the presence of additional gravitropic movement regulation currently undescribed by the AC model. Examining average measures of elongation growth rate, we found that straight coleoptiles had a slightly higher average REGR than those in the tilted group. When looking at a temporal plot of REGR over time (Fig 8), we observed that tilted plants had a slightly lower REGR at the beginning of the experiment, but that this difference quickly dissipated over time. This result is not surprising as tilting a plant disrupts the flow of the growth hormone auxin, causing a temporary reduction in elongation and growth [5]. When we compared average curvature variation between groups, we found a highly significant difference in curvature variation within the first 12 hours after perturbation, with tilted coleoptiles\\nCloser temporal examination of the morphometric data revealed pulses along the entire length of the aerial organ in elongation growth rate and variation of curvature over time (Fig 8). By tracking the maxima of these pulses over time, we observed that these oscillations in elongation growth rate and variation of curvature travelled from the apex to the base of the coleoptile. Other oscillations in different forms of plant growth have been described in the literature [24], but these reports are infrequent and the features of these oscillations are clearly different from what we have observed in the current study. Indeed most of the growth oscillations reported in the literature so far occur during the nutation of the aerial organ (e.g. in sunflowers [25]), or in particular plant organs/cells such as pollen tubes and root hairs [20, 26, 27].\\n\\nDuring studies of nutation in sunflowers, oscillations of different growth were identified by comparing growth rates on opposing lateral sides of the plant organ [25]. However, our observed oscillations traveled from the apex of the aerial organ to the base along the median line, and so cannot be accounted for by plant nutation. In addition, the oscillations of growth that have been described in pollen tubes and root hairs [26, 27] are limited to occurring at the very tips of these organs. This scale and localization of growth oscillations are completely different from what we have observed in the current study.\\n\\nFig 9. Curvature variation for each individual coleoptile. A. Averaged over the first 12 hours post-perturbation, and B. greater than 12h after perturbation (up to the end of the experiment). Red lines represent coleoptiles from the straight group, while blue lines represent data from tilted coleoptiles.\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194893.g009\\ndifferent from those observed in our coleoptiles, which occurred along the entire length of the aerial organ.\\n\\nNeither oscillation period, nor oscillation velocity in REGR significantly differed between tilted and untilted coleoptiles, demonstrating that our gravitropic perturbation had no effect on the oscillatory patterns of REGR. A potential candidate to explain the REGR pulses that were observed in both groups of coleoptiles is auxin, as well-known and major growth factor in plants. The average velocity of propagation of auxin in coleoptiles (12 mm/h) according to [28, 29] is compatible with our own measurements ($v_p = 11.3 \\\\pm 6.0$ mm/h for straight coleoptiles and $v_p = 12.3 \\\\pm 6.6$ mm/h for tilted coleoptiles). However, the average period of time between two pulses in our data set ($t_p = 2.2$ h) is four for five times longer than the pulses of auxin that have been previously recorded in coleoptiles [30\\u201332]. Therefore, while auxin may be driving some aspects of the REGR oscillations in our coleoptiles, the previously known dynamics of auxin can\\u2019t completely explain the presence and features of these oscillations.\\n\\nWhile gravitropic treatment group did not affect features of REGR oscillations, it did affect features of oscillations in curvature variation. Between coleoptiles from the straight and tilted groups there were significant differences in oscillation period and the velocity of oscillation pulses, with tilted coleoptiles demonstrating oscillations with shorter periods that travelled more slowly along the aerial organ. Similar oscillations of curvature variation have been previously identified during gravitropic movement [18]. But no conclusive mechanisms were found to explain these oscillations as the study relied only on apical tracking, a method of gathering global measurements that can neglect more detailed and local movement dynamics (see [20] for a discussion on the limits of apical tracking).\\n\\nMost interestingly, we observed a relationship between oscillations in REGR and curvature variation in tiled coleoptiles (Fig 8), demonstrating that tilted coleoptiles had greater coupling between curvature and REGR than straight coleoptiles. This relationship was moderately strong and negative, demonstrating that regions of lower REGR were associated with higher variation of curvature, and indicating an asynchronous regulatory mechanism that causes the oscillations of elongation growth and curvature variation to be shifted and slightly out of phase. Local curvature and growth are indeed known to be correlated in plants, and curvature variation can be expressed as a function of the elongation rate:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{DC(s, t)R}{Dt} \\\\sim \\\\hat{E}(s, t)\\\\Delta(s, t)$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\Delta(s, t)$ accounts for the distribution of the differential growth on each side of the coleoptile during elongation [5]. As no global shrinking of plant aerial organs are expected during growth, elongation $\\\\hat{E}(s, t)$ will always have a positive value. Therefore, the local elongation rate can only modulate the amplitude of curvature rate, but not its sign, so elongation alone cannot affect the direction in which the organ is curved. However, we observed both a negative correlation between REGR and curvature variation oscillations and a fewer than predicted number of overshoots. Combined, these two results seems to indicate the presence of an additional mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between local growth and curvature, as well as the sign of curvature rate.\\n\\nLimitations in our current study prevents us from making further conclusions about the role of correlated oscillations in regulating gravitropism. First, a better understanding and more formal description of this potential mechanism term, could come from comparing the oscillatory behaviors of tilted coleoptiles that did and did not overshoot the vertical. Indeed, greater experimental examination would let us know if and how this regulation changes with variation in non-verticality. However, in the current study the actual number of overshoots\\nwas smaller than expected from the theoretical model, and did not provide us with a sample size large enough for statistical comparison with tilted coleoptiles that failed to overshoot the vertical. Given the low rate of overshoots, acquiring a sufficient sample size would require hundreds, perhaps thousands, of wheat coleoptiles to be tested. This approach could also allow us to determine if correlated oscillations in REGR and curvature variation are a general phenomenon among plant species. Secondly, we observed that the oscillations of curvature variation did not disappear after the tilted plants reach a potential gravitropic equilibrium (approached vertical). Without being able to compare plants that did and did not overshoot the vertical, it is impossible to decipher between the possibilities that coupled growth and curvature oscillations is a regulatory mechanism that actively prevents overshoots, and a coincidental observation that tilted coleoptiles both don\\u2019t overshoot the vertical as often as predicted and show greater coupled growth and curvature oscillations than straight plants.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation in coleoptiles. The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature. While we were unable to formalize our description of this relationship due to study limitations, we have described methodologically straightforward ways to proceed. Continuing this line of study will result in a greater understanding of adaptive mechanisms that allow plants to effectively control their posture throughout their lives.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nRB wants to thanks St\\u00e9phane Ploquin for his help with the experimental setup.

Base was added subsequently into the solution. The crude product was filtered out, washed 5 times by water or methanol and then dried in an air oven for 4 hours.\\n\\nAll the reactions were first performed with fresh base-IL medium so as to reach the saturation of product. The yields then were determined in the reuse of the \\u201cold\\u201d medium.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nDetermination of molar mass was performed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Autoflex III mass spectrometer (Bruker) in linear, positive ion mode with \\u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Samples for the mass spectrometry were prepared by dissolving the product (0.10 mg) in DMAC (5.0 mL) at 40\\u00b0C and then adding 100 \\u03bcL of this solution to a water/acetonitrile mixture (50:50, 900 \\u03bcL). The resulting sample was filtered through a 0.02 \\u03bcm PTFE membrane and injected at a flow rate of 5 \\u03bcL/min.\\nFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured by using a Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker).\\n\\nGel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analysis was performed on an Agilent PL GPC 220 instrument equipped with a Waters 2414 detector and 2 PolarGel-M 10\\u03bcm columns. All GPC analyses were performed using a DMF solution at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 60 \\u00b0C and calibrated with polystyrene standards. Samples for GPC analysis were prepared by dissolving the product (0.1 mg) in DMAc with 0.1% LiBr (5.0 mL) at 40\\u00b0C and filtered through a 0.02 \\u03bcm PTFE membrane prior to injection.\\n\\nTg was measured by using a DSC instrument (Pyris 6, Perkin Elmer). Sample weighed 10.0 mg and the analysis was carried out at a 10 \\u00b0C/min heating rate under nitrogen purge (25 mL/min). Temperature and heat flow were calibrated using indium and zinc standards.\\n\\nA TGA instrument (Pyris 6, Perkin Elmer) was used to evaluate the thermal stability of the polyimides. The analysis was carried out at a 10 \\u00b0C/min heating rate under nitrogen purge (25 mL/min). The weight loss signal was detected as a function of time and temperature.\\n\\nTable S2\\n\\n| Entry | IL            | Base (mol%) | T (\\u00b0C) | M_n (kDa) | M_w/M_n | Yield%/Time |\\n|-------|---------------|-------------|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|\\n| S1    | [C\\u2082mim][OAc] |             | r.t.   | 14.2      | 1.46    | Fig. S4     |\\n| S2    | [C\\u2084mim][OAc] |             | r.t.   | 12.5      | 1.61    | Fig. S4     |\\n| S3    | [C\\u2084mim][PF\\u2086] |             | r.t.   | -

Over the past years whole field of view optical non-invasive testing has been widely used in many areas, from industrial ones to, for instance, biomedical research topics. To measure the surface contour from the tympanic membrane (TM) of ex-vivo cats digital holographic interferometry (DHI) is used in combination with a two-illumination positions method: the shape is directly measured from the phase change between two source positions by means of a digital Fourier transform method. The TM shape data in conjunction with its displacement data renders a complete and accurate description of the TM deformation, a feature that no doubt will serve to better comprehend the hearing process. Acquiring knowledge from the tissue shape indicates a mechanical behavior and, indirectly, an alteration in the physiological structure due to middle ear diseases or damages in the tissue that can deteriorate sound transmission. The TM shape contour was successfully measured by using two source positions within DHI showing that the TM has a conical shape. Its maximum depth was found to be 2 mm, considering the umbo as the reference point with respect to the TM annulus plane, where the setup is arranged in such a manner that it is capable of measuring a height of up to 7 mm.\\n\\n\\u00a9 2012 Optical Society of America\\n\\nOCIS codes: (090.0090) Holography; (120.0120) Instrumentation, measurement, and metrology;\\n(170.0170) Medical optics and biotechnology.\\n\\nReferences and links\\n\\n1.

Introduction\\n\\nShape measurement of an object facilitates the understanding of its working mechanisms in several phenomena in different scientific research areas as well as in technology and industry. For this purpose, different mechanical tests and numerous non-invasive optical methods for shape measurement have been developed [1\\u20137]. Optical methods in particular have undergone a variety of innovations due to the continuous and rapid advances in the hardware used in them, namely electronic and computer-processor devices. In consequence, optical methods such as Moir\\u00e9, Fringe Projection and Digital Holographic Interferometry (DHI) can acquire more precise object shape data with higher resolution.\\n\\nDHI is used in combination with two source positions to measure the TM shape. DHI has in the past demonstrated its usefulness in the quantification of displacements and vibration analysis of diverse solid samples, and in the quantification of refractive-index changes in transparent objects, among many other successful applications [8\\u201311]. Furthermore, it is a non-invasive technique that provides full field-of-view measurements of static and dynamic events by means of the analysis of wavefronts recorded at different points in time which provide useful information to determine various important parameters from the object under study, e.g., amplitude and direction displacements or stress and strain values.\\n\\nDue to its simplicity the two source positions technique is used to measure shapes in a wide range of applications. It consists in moving the object illumination source from one position to another in a typical-simpler optical out of plane setup (see Fig. 1). This is compared to techniques such as fringe projection, moir\\u00e9 interferometry, or low coherence interferometry, just to mention a few, where the setups and hardware employed may be more complicated to implement for this particular application.\\n\\nThe tympanic membrane has been studied with different techniques capable of measuring surface mechanical parameters and displacements [12\\u201316]. However, most of them do not consider the shape in their data analyses. The TM delicate tissue is crucial to the hearing process in the middle ear structure for it vibrates beneath sound pressure. If the TM undergoes changes in its structure and mechanical properties due to ear disease, sound transmission can\\nbe deteriorated and loss of conductive hearing may be caused. Several works have been\\ndevoted to TM shape measurements by means of optical methods, but the most of them use\\nmoire interferometry and fringe projection with a phase shifting method [17-21].\\n\\nThis paper\\u2019s main goal rests at measuring the TM shape of an ex-vivo cat by means of two\\nobject source illumination positions in combination with digital holographic interferometry. In\\na typical out of plane setup, the light from the dividing beam splitter is conveyed through an\\noptical fiber that mounted in a connector adaptor is used to launch the object illumination\\nbeam. A first digital hologram is recorded with the object beam at illumination point 1, and\\nthen the optical fiber is slightly translated (by a few micrometers) to illumination point 2, and\\nthis serves to record the second digital hologram. The optimum object illumination direction is\\nusually determined by a trade-off between the maximum setup sensitivity and minimum\\nshadows casted in the reconstructed image. The shape is directly determined from the phase\\nchange between those two source positions, where it is calculated from the recorded digital\\nhologram intensities using a digital Fourier transform method. Experiments were first carried\\nout using a metal sphere to verify the procedure, and once proved repeatable it was applied to\\nmeasure the TM shape which was found to have a conical shape, with a maximum depth of 2\\nmm, considering the umbo as the reference point with respect to the TM annulus plane.\\n\\nThis above procedure is fast in that it requires only two images and uses the same optical\\nsetup to quantify motion displacements, also avoiding the commonly found rigid body motion\\nthat might produce inaccuracies during the data acquisition procedure. It may be safely stated\\nthat the main contribution of this work is the finding of the TM shape using digital\\nholographic interferometry, since more accurate and reliable information can be given in\\ncombination with displacement measurements, thus completing the study of the TM\\nphysiological behavior. With these advantageous features, DHI proves to be best suited to\\nstudy biological samples.\\n\\n2. Shape determination\\n\\nThe setup used for the measurement of the TM shape is shown in Fig. 1. This system is based\\non digital holography interferometry. The laser source (532 nm) is divided into two beams,\\none serves as the reference beam and the other as the object beam. Both are coupled to an\\noptical fiber launcher, allowing the easiness to place the reference/object beams in any\\nposition. Only the object beam is mounted in a micrometer translation stage. The\\nbackscattered light coming from the illuminated object is collected by a doublet lens of 30\\nmm focal length that is placed 5 cm away from the camera CCD sensor. The object and\\nreference beam are recombined by means of a beam combiner on the CCD sensor that\\nregisters the digital holographic interferograms finally stored and processed in a computer.\\n\\nThe process for recording the holograms with the two source positions is described in\\nreferences [6,22]. A first digital holographic interferogram is recorded with the object beam at\\npoint \\\\(p_1\\\\); then, the optical fiber is slightly moved laterally to point \\\\(p_2\\\\) to record the second\\ndigital holographic interferogram. The phase reconstruction is achieved by means of the\\nFourier transform method which allows us to obtain the wavefront complex amplitude and\\nphase for each hologram.\\n\\nThe surface shape can be decoded by calculating the Fourier transform, followed by a\\ndedicated filter in its spatial frequency domain, and finally calculating its inverse Fourier\\ntransform. Briefly in mathematical terms, the latter procedure is described as follows: first the\\nCCD records an intensity given by\\n\\n\\\\[\\nI(x_H, y_H) = |R(x_H, y_H) + U(x_H, y_H)|^2 \\\\\\\\\\n= |R(x_H, y_H)|^2 + |U(x_H, y_H)|^2 \\\\\\\\\\n+ R(x_H, y_H)U^*(x_H, y_H) + R^*(x_H, y_H)U(x_H, y_H),\\n\\\\]  \\n\\n(1)\\nwhere $x_H$ and $y_H$ are the coordinates on the hologram plane (CCD sensor), and the asterisk means the complex amplitude conjugate, with\\n\\n$$U(x_H, y_H) = u(x_H, y_H) \\\\exp[i\\\\phi(x_H, y_H)]$$\\n\\nand\\n\\n$$R(x_H, y_H) = r(x_H, y_H) \\\\exp[i\\\\phi(x_H, y_H) - 2\\\\pi i(f_x x_H + f_y y_H)]$$\\n\\nin which, $r(x_H, y_H)$ is the smooth reference wave, and $u(x_H, y_H)$ is an object wave, with $i = \\\\sqrt{-1}$. The intensity becomes\\n\\n$$I(x_H, y_H) = a(x_H, y_H) + c(x_H, y_H) \\\\exp[2\\\\pi i(f_x x_H + f_y y_H)] + c^*(x_H, y_H)\\\\left[-2\\\\pi i(f_x x_H + f_y y_H)\\\\right],$$\\n\\nwhere\\n\\n$$a(x_H, y_H) = u^2(x_H, y_H) + r^2(x_H, y_H)$$\\n\\nand\\n\\n$$c(x_H, y_H) = u(x_H, y_H) r(x_H, y_H) \\\\exp[i\\\\phi(x_H, y_H)]$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\phi(x_H, y_H) = \\\\phi_u(x_H, y_H) - \\\\phi_r(x_H, y_H)$ and applying the Fourier transform to Eq. (2) gives\\n\\n$$TF[I] = A(f_x, f_y) + C(f_x, f_y) + C^*(f_x, f_y).$$\\n\\nHere $C$ and $C^*$ indicate a complex-conjugate pair, each containing the object phase information $\\\\phi(x, y)$.\\n\\nIn the spatial Fourier domain they are separated from one another due to a carrier introduced by tilting slightly the beam combiner located in front of the CCD sensor. Only one term, $C$ or $C^*$ is chosen and band-pass filtered, with the term $A(f_x, f_y)$ filtered out at this stage. The inverse Fourier transform is applied and is given complex number, $c(x, y)$.\\n\\nThe resultant phase for each of the two illumination positions is given by\\n\\n$$\\\\phi(x, y) = \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\text{Im}(c(x, y))}{\\\\text{Re}(c(x, y))}\\\\right]$$\\n\\nwhere Im and Re denote the imaginary and real parts of $c(x, y)$, respectively.\\n\\nFinally, the object shape is found by the phase-difference from $\\\\phi_1$ and $\\\\phi_2$; i.e., the TM surface contour height change is given by\\n\\n$$\\\\Delta \\\\phi(x, y) = \\\\phi_2(x, y) - \\\\phi_1(x, y)$$\\n\\n$$= \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\text{Re}(c_2(x, y))\\\\text{Im}(c_2(x, y)) - \\\\text{Im}(c_1(x, y))\\\\text{Re}(c_2(x, y))}{\\\\text{Im}(c_2(x, y))\\\\text{Re}(c_1(x, y)) + \\\\text{Re}(c_1(x, y))\\\\text{Im}(c_2(x, y))}\\\\right].$$\\n\\n$\\\\Delta \\\\phi(x, y)$ is related with the change in optical path length sensitivity of the setup which is given by the geometrical optics arrangement: it is determined by the illumination and observation directions. In Fig. 1, the illumination direction is denoted with the unitary vector $\\\\hat{k}_1$. The observation direction is denoted with the unitary vector $\\\\hat{k}_0$. \\n\\n---\\n\\n#176000 - $15.00 USD Received 11 Sep 2012; revised 18 Oct 2012; accepted 4 Nov 2012; published 8 Nov 2012\\n(C) 2012 OSA 1 December 2012 / Vol. 3, No. 12 / BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS 3206\\nThe object beam angle $\\\\theta$ is measured from the fixed position of object illumination to the axis perpendicular to the geometrical center of the CCD sensor $\\\\hat{k}_0$. The angular displacement $\\\\Delta \\\\theta$ is determined by the source of object illumination that was slightly translated from one point to another $p_1$\\u2013$p_2$, using a micrometric screw. The measurement of the contour of the sample is obtained by subtracting the phase of the two holograms acquired at two different illumination positions, as described above. Performing some geometrical calculations, that phase-difference is now written in terms of $\\\\theta$ and $\\\\Delta \\\\theta$ as\\n\\n$$\\\\Delta \\\\varphi(x, y) = 2k \\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\theta}{2} \\\\cos \\\\left( \\\\theta + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\theta}{2} \\\\right) - 2k \\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\theta}{2} h(x, y) \\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\theta + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\theta}{2} \\\\right),$$  \\n\\nwhere $k = 2\\\\pi/\\\\lambda$. Therefore, we can determine the object height-change $h = (x, y)$ that results from the difference between the reconstructed phases, $\\\\varphi_1$ and $\\\\varphi_2$, which were recorded before and after a small tilt $\\\\Delta \\\\theta$ introduced in the object illuminating beam. Equation (6) is the same as the one found in Ref. [22], where the object shape is found using phase shifting and a reconstruction algorithm in a rather similar procedure than the one used here.\\n\\nThe following approximation, for small angles, serves to evaluate the setup sensitivity ($\\\\Delta h$) for the TM height,\\n\\n$$\\\\Delta h \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\Delta \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\theta},$$\\n\\nwhich results in 7 mm.\\n\\n3. Results\\n\\nAs a first test, we measured the shape of a metal sphere of 5 mm radius with an illumination angle $\\\\theta$ set at 36\\u00b0 with respect to the CCD sensor axis. The centre of the sphere was positioned at a distance $Z = 300$ mm from the CCD sensor set to $z = 0$, i.e., the origin of the coordinate system. The images were recorded with a 1392x1024 pixels CCD camera at 12 bit resolution. The camera acquisition speed is 11 fps, and the interframing time is 5 $\\\\mu$s. The total recording time is approximately 180 ms. It is necessary to add the time required for the processing of holograms and the TM contour calculation. The total time to display the TM contour results is about two minutes.\\n\\nFigure 2a represents the distribution of the wrapped phase, where the object is surrounded by a mask to prevent unwanted noise in the reconstruction. The phase unwrapping image corresponding to a sloped sphere is shown in Fig. 2b. The tilt component must be removed by\\nthe subtraction of the first term in Eq. (6), see Fig. 3. We also calculated the error in the optical phase between two adjacent phase contours resulting in an error value of $\\\\sim \\\\pi/12$.\\n\\nThe sensitivity of the system is determined by the wavelength and the geometry of the experimental setup such that the angle produced by the source of illumination that was slightly translated from one point to another, can be simply changed to obtain different sensitivity values. This feature makes it possible to set up the tilt angle using a micrometric screw to guide the optical fiber that illuminates the object. In our test, the small angle was fixed at $\\\\Delta \\\\theta = 0.007^\\\\circ$. If is considered that the error introduced by the micrometer screw is half of its smallest division, 12.5 micrometers in the displacement, the error in the angle is $\\\\pm 0.0017^\\\\circ$ that results in a measurement capability ranging from 6.4 mm to 9.7 mm. However, extreme care was taken to make the measurements repeatable to minimize or better make this error negligible.\\n\\nReference [23] describes the manner in which the tissue has been prepared to be used before measuring the shape of the sample. As the TM has an irregular shape, it is placed with a particular orientation reducing the shadows to a minimum. The optimum illumination direction is usually determined by a trade-off between the maximum sensitivity and minimum shadows in the reconstructed image. The size and shape of the TM are highly different from one sample to another due to breed, age and any pathology that the tissue has. Figure 4 shows the experimentally found shape of the tympanic membrane and surface profile (a), and (b) the\\nshape given as a mesh data set that may be used to simulate the behavior of the tissue employing for instance finite element modeling (FEM). To measure the depth of the tympanic membrane, we consider the umbo as the reference point with respect to the tympanic annulus plane.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experimental results of the tympanic membrane contour. (a) 3D reconstruction and surface profile. (b) Mesh data shape.\\n\\n4. Conclusions\\n\\nDigital holographic interferometry combined with the two positions of object illumination method was used to measure the contour of the tympanic membrane, to the best of our knowledge reported for the first time in the literature. The shape found depicts accurately the TM surface contour, whose data can be employed to simulate its physiological behavior. DHI has shown again its usefulness to obtain contours of small and delicate biological tissues. Noninvasive rapid measurements of surface shape were performed in this work, making of this method a very useful one for medical applications.\\n\\nIt is a must to include the TM shape in surface deformation measurements in order to generate an accurate description of any displacement representation, being one or three\\ndimensional. The experimental results could be used to conduct a quantitative analysis such as the measurement of displacements, obtaining in this manner more accurate values with the same setup and no additional hardware. The sensitivity of the experimental setup was fixed to an optimal angle.\\n\\nKnowing the shape of the TM has an ontological significance because its topography is directly related with the ear's hearing function. The measurements made with this method could be useful to explore structural issues on surface sample thus aiding in making a better quantitative pathological diagnosis.\\n\\nMeasurements of biological tissues surface shape and their deformation are very important for biomechanical design, noninvasive inspection and TM its mathematical modeling.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nAll authors wish to thank the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\\u00eda (CONACYT) for supporting this research.\", \"source\": \"olmocr\", \"added\": \"2025-03-05\", \"created\": \"2025-03-05\", \"metadata\": {\"Source-File\": \"tests/gnarly_pdfs/not_parsing.pdf\", \"olmocr-version\": \"0.1.59\", \"pdf-total-pages\": 8, \"total-input-tokens\": 21049, \"total-output-tokens\": 6040, \"total-fallback-pages\": 0}, \"attributes\": {\"pdf_page_numbers\": [[0, 3485, 1], [3485, 8410, 2], [8410, 12376, 3], [12376, 14913, 4], [14913, 17455, 5], [17455, 19147, 6], [19147, 20338, 7], [20338, 21243, 8]]}}\n",

This enzyme is presented in different organisms, such as microorganisms, vegetal, and some animals, including certain rodent\\u2019s serum, but not unveiled in humans. It can be used as important chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of a variety of lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphomas (particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Hodgkin\\u2019s lymphoma), and has been a pivotal agent in chemotherapy protocols from around 30 years. Also, other important application is in food industry, by using the properties of this enzyme to reduce acrylamide levels in commercial fried foods, maintaining their characteristics (color, flavor, texture, security, etc.) Actually, L-asparaginase catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-asparagine, not allowing the reaction of reducing sugars with this aminoacid for the generation of acrylamide. Currently, production of L-asparaginase is mainly based in biotechnological production by using some bacteria. However, industrial production also needs research work aiming to obtain better production yields, as well as novel process by applying different microorganisms to increase the range of applications of the produced enzyme. Within this context, this mini-review presents L-asparaginase applications, production by different microorganisms and some limitations, current investigations, as well as some challenges to be achieved for profitable industrial production.\\n\\n\\u00a9 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).\\nIndustrial L-asparaginase production presents some challenges, such as the search for new microorganisms able to produce it with less adverse effects. Nowadays, industrial production is carried out using bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. However, the enzyme obtained from prokaryotic microorganisms usually presents some problems such as hypersensitivity and immune inactivation. Within this context, eukaryotic microorganisms such as filamentous fungi and yeasts have been investigated for this enzyme production, due to better compatibility with the human system.\\n\\nCurrently, new studies have been carried out aiming to enhance production process and establish new ways for enzyme synthesis. Thus, some of these aspects are discussed, besides some generalities regarding L-asparaginase applications in pharmaceutical and food industries.\\n\\nReactions and mechanism\\n\\nThe hydrolysis process occurs in two steps through an intermediate: beta-acyl-enzyme (Fig. 1). In the first process step, the nucleophilic residue of the enzyme is activated by a strong base and attacks the amide carbon atom of L-asparagine (substrate), generating a product beta-acyl-enzyme intermediate. The second reaction step is an attack on the ester carbon made by a nucleophile activated by a water molecule. This mechanism is comparable to serine-proteases classic mechanism, whose activities depends of an amino acid group, classified as catalytic triads. This catalytic triads is composed by one nucleophilic amino acid, serine (Ser), one base, histidine (His) and one amino acid with acid characteristic, aspartic acid (Asp), all connected by hydrogen bonds.\\n\\nL-asparaginase has also capacity to catalase other reactions. For example, L-asparaginase produced by Serratia marcescens is able to hydrolyze 5% of L-glutamine when compared with L-asparaginase hydrolysis. The same effect occurs to L-asparaginase produced by Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. Other microorganisms, such as Pseudomonas sp. and Acinetobacter glutaminasificans, synthetize L-asparaginase with equal asparaginase and glutaminase activity. In some cases, L-asparaginase starts the L-glutamine hydrolysis only after complete conversion of L-asparaginase in aspartic acid. Actually, L-glutamine is a competitive inhibitor of L-asparaginase hydrolysis. L-glutamine and L-asparaginase hydrolysis are similar due to the structural similarity from both amino acids. Therefore, the largest part of microbial L-asparaginase presents cross glutaminase activity, with some exceptions such as L-asparaginase produced by Wolinella succinogenes, which do not present L-glutaminase activity. Finally, L-asparaginase is also able to hydrolyze \\u03b2-aspartyl peptide amide, however reaction yield is considerably low.\\n\\nL-asparaginase applications\\n\\nPharmaceutical industry: antineoplastic action\\n\\nThe L-asparagine enzymatic hydrolysis in L-aspartate and ammonium was observed in a first time by Lang (1904), that detected L-asparaginase activity in bovine's tissues. Results of this researcher were confirmed by Furth and Friedmann (1910), that detected L-asparagine hydrolyase in horse and pig organs, observing the same amount of L-asparaginase activity in both animals. Also, Clementi (1922) related that L-asparaginase in guinea pig serum, although antitumor activity of the enzyme was identified only some years later. In addition, Mashburn and Wriston (1964) demonstrated that L-asparaginase of E. coli had inhibitory capacity of tumors in rats. However, the large interest in enzyme started when Broome (1965) found that the regression lymphosarcoma transplants in rats treated with guinea pig serum was due to nutritional dependence on malignant cells of exogenous L-asparaginase.\\n\\nConsidering its properties, L-asparaginase has been an important chemotherapeutic agent used for treatment of lymphoproliferative and lymphoma diseases. Particularly, it presents large importance in chemotherapeutic protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Hodgkin\\u2019s lymphomas.\\n\\nCancer cells, mainly lymphatic cells, require high amount of asparagine for fast and malignant growth. In this way, cancer cells requires the amino acid from diet (blood serum) as well as amino acids produced by themselves. However, leukemic lymphoblasts and some others tumor cells do not have or present low quantity of L-asparagine synthetase used for L-asparagine synthetases. Thus, these malignant cells are dependent of asparagine from blood serum for their proliferation and survival.\\n\\nL-asparaginase hydrolyzes asparagine from blood serum, leading tumor cells to death by lacking of an essential factor for protein synthetases (p53-dependent apoptosis). However, healthy cells are not affected, because they are able to produce asparagine using L-asparaginase synthetase present in enough quantities (Fig. 2). Considering these concepts, Fig. 2 schematically shows the antineoplastic action of L-asparaginase.\\n\\nFood industry: acrylamide formation\\n\\nAcrylamide (C$_2$H$_2$NO) is also known as 2-propenamide, acrylic amide, ethylene carbamimde, propenamide, propionic acid amide, monomer of acrylamide or acrylic acid amide, presenting 71.08 g/mol of molecular mass. Several studies show that L-asparagine is the main amino acid responsible for acrylamide production in fried and baked foods when reducing sugars are condensed with a carbonyl source. This phenomenon does not occur in boiled food.\\n\\nAcrylamide formation has been quite studied in the last years. Zyazk et al. (2003) detected that the amide chain present in the acrylamide structure is provided from L-asparagine. Reagents (L-asparagine or reducing sugars) reduction or removal is one of the evaluated strategies for decreasing acrylamide quantity in foods. For L-asparagine reduction, several options have been investigated, such as: selection of vegetal species with lower level of L-asparagine in their composition; deletion of important enzymes for L-asparagine biosynthesis control by suppression of specific genes; acid hydrolysis of L-asparagine leading the formation of aspartic acid and ammonia; and acetylation process of L-asparagine to form N-acetyl-L-asparagine, preventing the formation of acrylamide from intermediate N-glycosides.\\nIn the study of Zyzak et al. (2003), authors confirmed that the use of L-asparaginase enzyme before frying or baking food process could reduce more than 99% acrylamide level in the processed final product. This is because the enzyme reduces more than 88% of the L-asparagine concentration from the initial feedstock. In last years, other works have dealt with this application of L-asparaginase, that can decrease the negative effects of acrylamide containing foods without impair their characteristics.\\n\\n**Production by different microorganisms**\\n\\nL-asparaginase is present in mammals, birds, plants, yeast, and a wide range of bacteria. Although L-asparaginase production is observed in animals, plants, and microorganisms are considered mainly source for L-asparagine synthesis.\\n\\nThe production of this enzyme is mainly proceeded by submerged fermentation. Several researchers have studied the isolation of microbial strains that produce this important enzyme, such as *Pseudomonas fluorescens*, *Serratia marcescens*, *Escherichia coli*, *Erwinia carotovora*, *Proteus vulgaris*, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, *Karnatakensis Streptomyces*, *Streptomyces venezuelae* and several genres of fungi as *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium* and *Fusarium*.\\n\\nConcerning to bacteria, the best producers of L-asparaginase are members of the Enterobacteriaceae family.\\n\\nFor example, in pharmaceutical industry, this enzyme is produced mainly from bacteria such as *Escherichia coli* and *Erwinia carotovora* (also known as *Erwinia chrysanthemi*), generally used for leukemia and lymphoma treatment. However, most of these treatments can result in immunological sensitization (hypersensitivity) and immune inactivation in patients that receive bacterial enzymes. Another issue is that glutaminase activity generated by these enzymes can cause secondary effects such as allergic reaction, nausea, pancreatitis, diabetes and coagulation abnormalities. Also, most of asparaginases has low stability and catalytic activity, presenting only active in a narrow pH range.\\n\\nCurrently, L-asparaginases from *E. coli* and *Erwinia chrysanthemi* (synonymous of *Erwinia carotovora*) are the only preparation available for medical use. L-asparaginase from *E. coli* produces two types of enzyme, L-asparaginase I (EC1), found in the cytoplasm and L-asparaginase II (EC2), with\\nHowever, only the second one has anti-cancer activity.41 Some studies describe EC1 as a constitutive enzyme and EC2 as secreted only as a response to exposure to low concentrations of nitrogen.42 EC2 has an estimated molecular weight of 141 kDa and its $K_M$ is about 12.5 $\\\\mu$M, meaning a high affinity for substrate.42 Its half-life is around 1.24 $\\\\pm$ 0.17 days and its optimum pH is 7\\u20138 and 37 \\u00b0C, respectively.43,44\\n\\nAs an alternative for treatment of patients allergic to L-asparaginase from E. coli, L-asparaginase from E. chrysanthemi (ErA) is used. It has half-life of 0.6 $\\\\pm$ 0.13 days, a $K_M$ of 18 $\\\\mu$M, molecular mass about 140 and 150 kDa, optimal pH 8 and 50 \\u00b0C as optimal temperature.45,46 The difference between its $K_M$ and that one from E. coli's L-asparaginase is because glutaminase activity of ErA is higher.47,48\\n\\nIn recent years, different studies were developed aiming to find this enzyme with improved characteristics compared to L-asparaginase from E. coli, with economically viable production as well as causing minimal collateral effects. Searching from different L-asparaginases sources, specifically eukaryotic microorganisms, can lead to enzymes with less adverse effects and different features, which are advantageous for its application.49\\n\\nIn the last years, eukaryotic fungi have been investigated as L-asparaginase source.47 For L-asparaginase production by fungi, the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium have been studied.50 Currently, fungal recombinant L-asparaginase from Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger has already been used in food industry for reduction of acrylamide formation in some foods.28 Moreover, authors have reported positive results by using endophytic fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, Eupenicillium, Talaromyces.48,49 Also, positive asparaginolytic activity were also shown by researchers that used fungi isolated from marine environments, endophytes seaweed, of genera Alternaria, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Curvularia, Nigrospora, Paeilomyces, Phaeotrichoconis, Phoma and Pithomyces.50 Within this context, Table 1 present some works related to L-asparaginase production by bacteria and fungi.\\n\\nAlso, several studies have shown that Aspergillus genus is available to produce significant amounts of L-asparaginase. For example, Sarquis et al. (2004)51 presented filamentous fungi like Aspergillus tamarii and Aspergillus terreus as producers of L-asparaginase by submerged fermentation, resulting in 38 U/L and 58.8 U/L, respectively. Authors concluded that enzyme production was regulated by the nitrogen source. Moreover, Balasubramanian et al. (2012),51 in a screening study of L-asparaginase producers, reported that Aspergillus terreus was able to produce 9.3 U/mL of enzyme. In other study of culture conditions optimization (temperature 35 \\u00b0C, initial pH 6.3, inoculum size 1% (v/v), agitation rate 140 rpm, and incubation time 58.5 h), Gurunathan and Sahadevan (2012)52 reported L-asparaginase production of Aspergillus terreus by submerged fermentation, reaching production of 44.38 U/mL. In another optimization project, but by using Aspergillus niger, Anjum Zia et al. (2013)53 verified a L-asparaginase activity of 2.83 U/mL under submerged fermentation. In that work, authors observed that glucose concentrations above 1% inhibited the enzyme production.\\n\\nAnother interesting technique for asparaginase production is the solid-state fermentation, that allows the use of agroindustrial residues as substrate or support.30 Within this context, recently, Dias et al. (2015)54 presented the use of different organic residues (wheat bran, soybean meal, cottonseed meal and orange peel), evaluating the production of L-asparaginase from Aspergillus niger. The maximum enzyme production (94.21 U/g) was obtained after 96 h of fermentation using mixture of wheat bran (1/3), soybean meal (1/3) and cottonseed meal (1/3).\\n\\nIn addition, yeasts have been becoming an interesting alternative for L-asparaginase production. Some investigations have reported, e.g., the use of the yeasts Pichia polymorpha and Candida utilis, for this enzyme production. L-asparaginase of P. polymorpha showed a $K_M$ value of 13.7 mM and optimum pH 6.7.27 On the other hand, the enzyme produced by C. utilis has $K_M$ value of 77 $\\\\mu$M.78 In a recent study, Soler et al. (2015)31 tested 43 different strains of yeasts, verifying that only strains of Issatchenkia orientalis and Rhodotorula glutinis showed periplasmic L-asparaginase activity when growth in liquid CD-m. Also, Sajitha et al. (2015)55 presented an investigation by using an expression study of gene anaB of E. coli, which encodes L-asparaginase enzyme, in yeast. This study was developed on a new protein expression system based on the yeast Pichia pastoris. The resulting enzyme was extracellular and showed activity of 2.5 U/mL at optimum temperature of 37 \\u00b0C. By these results, authors concluded that this new system of expression could be effective for production of humanized enzyme by glycosylation patterns similar to mammals.79\\n\\n**Industrial production of L-asparaginase**\\n\\nFor industrial production of L-asparaginase, many factors need to be taken into account aiming to a process with higher yield and economic viability. For example, type and concentration of carbon and nitrogen sources, pH, aeration, temperature, fermentation time, and, mainly, the microbial agent, have great influence in the process.56,57 As previously reported, several microorganisms are presented as L-asparaginase producers; however, bacteria E. coli and E. chrysanthemi are the current main microbial agents for industrial-scale production in pharmaceutical area, while the fungus Aspergillus oryzae is the most used in food industry.50,51 Fig. 3 shows an schematic representation for an industrial process for L-asparaginase production.\\n\\nDifferent types of culture medium have been explored for L-asparaginase production. However, carbon source and inducer (nitrogen source) are the more influencing components in the medium. For example, several studies have demonstrated that best inducers for reaching high yields are L-asparaginase,82,83 L-glutamine83 and L-proline,37,84-86 and the most common carbon source is glucose, in addition to alternative sources such as starch87 and maltose.82,88\\n\\nL-asparaginase extraction and purification are other pivotal steps for the production of this enzyme. For example, for pharmaceutical application, high level of purification is needed. Other important concern is that most of microorganisms produce intracellular L-asparaginases, with few exceptions.\\n\\nDifferent methods for downstream process are reported such as centrifugation, filtration, liquid-liquid extraction, chromatography and protein precipitation.

Additionally, the precipitant agent can be recycled in the final process, reducing the environmental impact associated to its disposal. Actually, precipitation is one of the first steps in the downstream process and it is usually combined with traditional techniques to enhance biomolecules purification and process yield.30 Also, other highlighted step used for high degree of enzyme purity is chromatography, such as ionic exchange, affinity chromatography, size exclusion, and gel filtration.71,89 For example, Lopes et al. (2015)30 reported that the most used purification steps are gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, which often are preceded by precipitation with (NH\\u2084)\\u2082SO\\u2084. According to authors, considering 50\\u201380% of the total production costs of proteins are provided by extraction and purification steps, optimized downstream can result in significant economic viability. For pharmaceutical applications, a step of conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG), or PEGylation, has been used to improve the compound biostability and bioavailability, influencing in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties of the enzyme and reducing the immunological response against this biomolecule.90 However, this step of PEGylation can also result in loss of biological activity of the conjugate compared with the native enzyme.91 On the other hand, this step is not required in food industry application.\\nFreeze-drying is other important step to improve the long and short-term storage of the enzyme L-asparaginase formulation. It can prevent most water-related reactions by sublimating water from the frozen product under vacuum, also allowing sterile drying without heating or chemical sterilization. However, problems related to cold denaturation, freeze denaturation and osmotic pressure increase due to dehydration and cryoconcentration.92\\n\\n**Conclusion and future recommendations**\\n\\nL-asparaginase is an interesting enzyme with important applications in pharmaceutical and food industry. However, its use in these industrial sectors requires some specific properties, as security for use by humans. As chemotherapeutic agent, an efficient action is required, in addition to reduced adverse effects, such as hypersensitivity and immune inactivation. In food, this enzyme helps to decrease the concentrations of acrylamide (carcinogenic compound for humans) formed in the process, maintaining their nutritional and sensory properties. Thus, research work seeking for new L-asparaginas, mainly produced by eukaryotic microorganisms, instead of bacterial enzymes currently used, has potential to obtain new enzymes with desirable properties. These discoveries have to be followed by an intensive work aiming to increase the process productivity to enable and extend the use of this enzyme, mainly in food industries. Taking this into account, tools of molecular biology are useful, although even a more traditional work of biochemical engineering have not been extensively related in literature, indicating needs of further works such as different process configuration evaluation, as well as use of bioreactors options.\\n\\n**Acknowledgments**\\n\\nThe authors would like to thank FAPESP (Process 2014/27055-2), CNPq, CAPES and Programa Estudantes-Conv\\u00eanio de P\\u00f3s-Gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o \\u2013 PEC-PG, da CAPES/CNPq \\u2013 Brazil for financial support, and the Cole\\u00e7\\u00e3o de Culturas Tropical Funda\\u00e7\\u00e3o Andr\\u00e9 Tosello.\\n\\n**REFERENCES**\\n\\n1.

As their commercial importance has surged, the most powerful models have become closed off, gated behind proprietary interfaces, with important details of their training data, architectures, and development undisclosed. Given the importance of these details in scientifically studying these models, including their biases and potential risks, we believe it is essential for the research community to have access to powerful, truly open LMs. To this end, we have built OLMo, a competitive, truly Open Language Model, to enable the scientific study of language models. Unlike most prior efforts that have only released model weights and inference code, we release OLMo alongside open training data and training and evaluation code.

Recently, due to large-scale pretraining and human annotation for alignment, they have become commercially valuable (OpenAI, 2023). However, as their commercial value has increased, the largest models have become gated behind proprietary interfaces, with important details left undisclosed.\\n\\nWe believe that full access to open language models for the research community is critical to the scientific study of these models, their strengths and weaknesses, and their biases and risks. Accordingly, we introduce OLMo, a powerful, truly open language model alongside open training data, training and evaluation code, intermediate model checkpoints, and training logs.\\n\\nRecent LM releases have varied in their degree of openness. For example, Mixtial 8x7B provided model weights and a brief report (Jiang et al., 2024), while LLaMA came with in-depth adaptation training instructions (Touvron et al., 2023b), and Mosaic Pretrained Transformer came with many details, including the dataset distribution, though not the data itself (MosaicML NLP Team,\", \"source\": \"olmocr\", \"added\": \"2025-03-05\", \"created\": \"2025-03-05\", \"metadata\": {\"Source-File\": \"tests/gnarly_pdfs/olmo-page-1.pdf\", \"olmocr-version\": \"0.1.59\", \"pdf-total-pages\": 1, \"total-input-tokens\": 6860, \"total-output-tokens\": 792, \"total-fallback-pages\": 0}, \"attributes\": {\"pdf_page_numbers\": [[0, 3122, 1]]}}\n",

There are a few basic computational concepts that are at the core of all programming languages. The exact elements making out such a set of concepts determine (1) the specific nature of the computational services such a language is designed for, (2) for what users it is intended, and (3) on what devices and in what environment it is to be used. It is therefore possible to propose a set of basic building blocks and operations thereon as combination procedures to enable programming software by specifying desired tasks using a tool-box of generic constructs and meta-operations. Syntax specified through LALR\\\\( (k) \\\\) grammar technology can be enhanced with greater recognizing power thanks to a simple augmentation of \\\\texttt{yacc} technology. Upon this basis, a set of implementable formal operational semantics constructs may be simply designed and generated (syntax and semantics) \\\\textit{\\u00e0 la carte}, by simple combination of its desired features. The work presented here, and the tools derived from it, may be viewed as a tool box for generating language implementations with a desired set of features. It eases the automatic practical generation of programming language pioneered by Peter Landin's SECD Machine. What is overviewed constitutes a practical computational algebra extending the polymorphically typed $\\\\lambda$-Calculus with object/classes and monoid comprehensions. This paper describes a few of the most salient parts of such a system, stressing most specifically any innovative features\\u2014formal syntax and semantics. It may be viewed as a high-level tour of a few reusable programming language design techniques prototyped in the form of a set of composable abstract machine constructs and operations.\\\\textsuperscript{1}\\n\\nKeywords: Programming Language Design; Object-Oriented Programming; Denotational Semantics; Operational Semantics; $\\\\lambda$-Calculus; Polymorphic Types; Static/Dynamic Type Checking/Inference; Declarative Collections; Monoid Comprehensions; Intermediate Language; Abstract Machines.\\n\\nThis article is dedicated to Peter Buneman, a teacher and a friend\\u2014for sharing the fun!

They also differ in physical appearance, and more important, in logical structure. The question arises, do the idiosyncrasies reflect basic logical properties of the situations that are being catered for? Or are they accidents of history and personal background that may be obscuring fruitful developments? This question is clearly important if we are trying to predict or influence language evolution.\\n\\nTo answer it we must think in terms, not of languages, but of families of languages. That is to say we must systematize their design so that a new language is a point chosen from a well-mapped space, rather than a laboriously devised construction.\\n\\nPeter J. Landin\\u2014\\u201cThe Next 700 Programming Languages\\u201d [31]\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\n1.1 Motivation\\u2014programming language design?\\n\\nToday, programming languages are designed more formally than they used to be fifty years ago. This is thanks to linguistic research that has led to syntactic science (begetting parser technology) and research in the formal semantics of programming constructs (begetting compiler technology\\u2014semantics-preserving translation from human-usable surface syntax to low-level instruction-based machine language). As in the case of a natural language, a grammar is used to control the formation of sentences (programs) that will be understood (interpreted/executed) according to the language\\u2019s intended (denotational/operational) semantics. Design based on formal syntax and semantics can thus be made operational.\\n\\nDesigning a programming language is difficult because it requires being aware of all the overwhelmingly numerous consequences of the slightest design decision that may occur anytime during the lexical or syntactical analyses, and the static or dynamic semantics phases. To this, we must add the potentially high design costs investing in defining and implementing a new language. These costs affect not only time and effort of design and development, but also the quality of the end product\\u2014viz., performance and reliability of the language being designed, not to mention how to justify, let alone guarantee, the correctness of the design\\u2019s implementation [37].\\n\\nFortunately, there have been design tools to help in the process. So-called meta-compiler have been used to great benefit to systematize the design and guarantee a higher quality of language implementation. The \\u201cmeta\\u201d part actually applies to the lexical and syntactic phases of the language design. Even then, the metasyntactic tools are often restricted to specific classes of grammars and/or parsing algorithms. Still fewer propose tools for abstract syntax. Most that do confine the abstract syntax language to some form of idiosyncratic representation of an attributed tree language with some ad hoc attribute co-dependence interpretation. Even rarer are language design systems that propose abstract and reusable components in the form of expressions of a formal typed\\nkernel calculus. It is such a system that this work proposes; it gives an essential overview of its design principle and the sort of services it has been designed to render.\\n\\nThis document describes the design of an abstract, reusable, and extensible, programming language architecture and its implementation in Java. What is described represents a generic basis insofar as these abstract and reusable constructs, and any well-typed compositions thereof, may be instantiated in various modular language configurations. It also offers a practical discipline for extending the framework with additional building blocks for new language features as per need. The first facet was the elaboration of $\\\\text{jacc}$, an advanced system for syntax-directed compiler generation extending yacc technology [28]. A second facet was the design of a well-typed set of abstract-machine constructs complete enough to represent higher-order functional programming in the form of an object-oriented $\\\\lambda$-Calculus, extended with monoid comprehensions [14,15,13,22]. A third facet could be the integration of logic-relational (from Logic Programming) and object-relational (from Database Programming) enabling LIFE-technology [4,7] and/or any other CP/LP technology to cohabit.\\n\\nWhat is described here is therefore a metadesign: it is the design of a design tool. The novelty of what is described here is both in the lexical/syntactical phase and in the typing/execution semantic phase.\\n\\nThe lexical and syntactic phases are innovative in many respects. In particular, they are conservative extensions considerably enhancing the conventional lex/yacc technology (or, similarly, flex/bison) meta-lexico-syntactical tools [28,19] with more efficient implementation algorithms [34] and recognizing power (viz., overloaded grammar symbols, dynamic operator properties \\u00e0 la Prolog. This essentially gives $\\\\text{jacc}$ the recognizing power of LALR($k$) grammars, for any $k \\\\geq 1$.) Sections 2.1 and 2.2 give more details on that part of the system.\\n\\nThe interpretation is essentially the same approach as the one advocated by Landin for his Store-Environment-Code-Dump (SECD) machine [30] and optimized by Luca Cardelli in his Functional Abstract Machine (FAM) [16]. The abstract machine we present here is but a systematic taking advantage of Java\\u2019s object-oriented tool-set to put together a modular and extensible set of building blocks for language design. It is sufficiently powerful for expressing higher-order polymorphic object-oriented functional and/or imperative programming languages. This includes declarative collection-processing based on the concept of Monoid Comprehensions as used in object-oriented databases [14,15,13,22,25].\\n\\n---\\n\\n2 http://www.hassan-ait-kaci.net/hlt/doc/jaccdoc/000STARTHERE.html\\n3 See Section 2.1.\\n4 Other formally derived abstract machines like the Categorical Abstract Machine (CAM) also led to variants of formal compilation of functional languages (e.g., Caml). This approach was also adopted for the chemical metaphor formalizing concurrent computation as chemical reaction originally proposed by Ban\\u00e2tre and Le M\\u00e9tayer [8] and later adapted by Berry and Boudol to define their Chemical Abstract Machine (ChAM) [9]. The same also happened for Logic Programming [3].\\n5 That is, at the moment, our prototype Algebraic Query Language (AQL v0.00) is a functional language augmented with a calculus of comprehensions \\u00e0 la Fegaras-Maier [22], or \\u00e0 la Grust [25]. In other words, it is a complete query language, powerful enough to express most of ODMG\\u2019s OQL, and thus many of its derivatives such as, e.g., XQuery [12] and\\nThis machine was implemented and used by the author to generate several experimental 100%-java implementation of various language prototypes. Thus, what was actually implemented in this toolkit was done following a \\u201cby need\\u201d priority order. It is not so complete as to already encompass all the necessary building blocks needed for all known styles of programming and type semantics. It is meant as an open set of tools to be extended as the needs arise. For example, there is no support yet for $\\\\mathcal{LP}$ [3], nor\\u2014more generally\\u2014$\\\\mathcal{CLP}$ [27].\\n\\nHowever, as limited as it may be, it already encompasses most of the basic familiar constructs from imperative and functional programming, including declarative aggregation (so-called \\u201ccomprehensions\\u201d). Therefore, it is clearly impossible\\u2014not to say boring!\\u2014to cover all the nitty-gritty details of all the facets of the complete abstract machine generation system. This article is therefore organized as an informal stroll over the most interesting novel features or particularities of our design as it stands to date.\\n\\n### 1.2 Our approach\\u2014abstract programming language design\\n\\nThe approach we follow is that of compiling a specific relatively more sophisticated outer syntax into a simpler instruction-based \\u201cmachine\\u201d language. However, for portability, this inner language is that of an \\u201cabstract\\u201d machine. In other words, it is just an intermediate language that can be either interpreted more efficiently on an emulator of that abstract machine, and/or be mapped to actual instruction-based assembly code of a specific machine more easily.\\n\\nThus, as for most compiled typed programming languages, there are actually several languages:\\n\\n- a *surface language*\\u2014the syntax used by users to compose programs;\\n- a *kernel language*\\u2014the \\u201cessential\\u201d language into which the surface language is normalized;\\n- a *type language*\\u2014the language describing the types of expressions;\\n- an *intermediate language*\\u2014the language that is executable on an instruction-based abstract machine.\\n\\nAlthough we will not develop it into much detail in this paper, the Java execution backend for carrying out the operational semantics of the above \\u00e0 la carte design consists of:\\n\\n- an *operational semantic language*\\u2014interpreting an abstract instruction set having effects on a set of runtime structures. The latter define the state of an execution automaton. The objects operated on and stored in these structures are the basic data representation all surface language constructs.\\n\\n---\\n\\nXPath [33], etc., \\u2026 This version of AQL can be run both interactively and in batch mode. In the former case, a user can define top-level constructs and evaluate expressions. AQL v0.00 supports 2nd-order (ML-like) type polymorphism, automatic currying, associative arrays, multiple type overloading, dynamic operator overloading, as well as (polymorphic) type definition (both aliasing and hiding), classes and objects, and (of course) monoid homomorphisms and comprehensions (*N.B.*: no subtyping nor inheritance yet\\u2014but this is next on the agenda [23,24,10,11]).\\n- **A type-directed display manager**\\u2014maintaining a trace emulation of abstract machine code execution in relation to the source code it was generated from.

Section 2 overviews original generic syntax-processing tools that have been conceived, implemented, and used to ease the experimental front-end development for language processing systems. Section 3 gives a high-level description of the architectural attributes of a set of kernel classes of programming language constructs and how they are processed for typing, compiling, and executing. Section 4 discusses the type system, which is made operational as a polymorphic type inference abstract machine enabling multiple-type overloading, type encapsulation, object-orientation, and type (un)boxing analysis. Section 5 sums up the essentials of how declarative iteration over collections may be specified using the notion of monoid homomorphism and comprehension as used in object-oriented databases query languages to generate efficient collection-processing code. Section 6 concludes with a quick recapitulation of the contents and future perspectives.\\n\\nIn order to make this paper as self-contained as possible, the above overview of salient aspects of the system that has been implemented is followed by an Appendix of brief tutorials on essential key concepts and terminology this work relies upon, and/or extends.\\n\\n---\\n\\n6 This is essentially a three-way SECD/FAM used to avoid systematically having to \\u201cbox\\u201d into objects primitive Java values (viz., of type `int` and `double`). This enables precious optimization that is particularly needed when dealing with variables of static polymorphic types but dynamically instantiated into `int` and `double`.\\n\\n7 Here and in what follows, we shall the following abbreviated class path notation:\\n\\n- `\\u27e8{syntax}\\u27e9` for \\u201chlt.language.syntax.\\u201d\\n- `\\u27e8{design}\\u27e9` for \\u201chlt.language.design.\\u201d and this latter package\\u2019s sub-packages:\\n  - `\\u27e8{kernel}\\u27e9` for \\u201c{design}.kernel.\\u201d\\n  - `\\u27e8{types}\\u27e9` for \\u201c{design}.types.\\u201d\\n  - `\\u27e8{instructions}\\u27e9` for \\u201c{design}.instructions.\\u201d\\n  - `\\u27e8{backend}\\u27e9` for \\u201c{design}.backend.\\u201d\\n\\nwhen referring to actual classes\\u2019 package paths.\\n2 Syntax Processing\\n\\n2.1 Jacc\\u2014Just another compiler compiler\\n\\nAt first sight, Jacc may be seen as a \\u201c100% Pure Java\\u201d implementation of an LALR(1) parser generator [2] in the fashion of the well-known UNIX tool yacc\\u2014\\u201cyet another compiler compiler\\u201d [28]. However, Jacc is much more than... just another compiler compiler: it extends yacc to enable the generation of flexible and efficient Java-based parsers and provides enhanced functionality not so commonly available in other similar systems.\\n\\nThe fact that Jacc uses yacc\\u2019s metasyntax makes it readily usable on most yacc grammars. Other Java-based parser generators all depart from yacc\\u2019s format, requiring nontrivial metasyntactic preprocessing to be used on existing yacc grammars\\u2014which abound in the world, yacc being by far the most popular tool for parser generation. Importantly, Jacc is programmed in pure Java\\u2014this makes it fully portable to all existing platforms, and immediately exploitable for web-based software applications.\\n\\nJacc further stands out among other known parser generators, whether Java-based or not, thanks to several additional features. The most notable are:\\n\\n- Jacc uses the most efficient algorithm known to date for its most critical computation (viz., the propagation of LALR(1) lookahead sets). Traditional yacc implementations use the method originally developed by DeRemer and Penello [19]. Jacc uses an improved method due to Park, Choe, and Chang [34], which drastically ameliorates the method of by DeRemer and Penello. To this author\\u2019s best knowledge, no other Java-based metacompiler system implements the Park, Choe, and Chang method [18].\\n- Jacc allows the user to define a complete class hierarchy of parse node classes (the objects pushed on the parse stack and that make up the parse tree: nonterminal and terminal symbols), along with any Java attributes to be used in semantic actions annotating grammar rules. All these attributes are accessible directly on any pseudo-variable associated with a grammar rule constituents (i.e., $1, $2, etc.).\\n- Jacc makes use of all the well-known conveniences defining precedences and associativity associated to some terminal symbols for resolving parser conflicts that may arise. While such conflicts may in theory be eliminated for any LALR(1) grammar, such a grammar is rarely completely obtainable. In that case, yacc technology falls short of providing a safe parser for non-LALR grammar. Yet, Jacc can accommodate any such eventual unresolved conflict using non-deterministic parse actions that may be tried and undone.\\n- Further still, Jacc can also tolerate non-deterministic tokens. In other words, the same token may be categorized as several distinct lexical units to be tried in turn. This allows, for example, parsing languages that use no reserved keywords (or more precisely, whose keywords may also be tokenized as identifiers, for instance).\\n- Better yet, Jacc allows dynamically (re-)definable operators in the style of the Prolog language (i.e., at parse-time and run-time). This offers great flexibility for on-the-fly syntax customization, as well as a much greater recognition power, even\\nwhere operator symbols may be overloaded (i.e., specified to have several precedences and/or associativity for different arities).\\n\\n- Jacc supports partial parsing. In other words, in a grammar, one may indicate any nonterminal as a parse root. Then, constructs from the corresponding sublanguage may be parsed independently from a reader stream or a string.\\n\\n- Jacc automatically generates a full HTML documentation of a grammar as a set of interlinked files from annotated /**...*/ javadoc-style comments in the grammar file, including a navigatable pure grammar in \\u201cyacc form,\\u201d obtained after removing all semantic and serialization annotations, leaving only the bare syntactic rules.\\n\\n- Jacc may be directed to build a parse-tree automatically (for the concrete syntax, but also for a more implicit form which rids a concrete syntax tree of most of its useless information). By contrast, regular yacc necessitates that a programmer add explicit semantic actions for this purpose.\\n\\n- Jacc supports a simple annotational scheme for automatic XML serialization of complex Abstract Syntax Trees (AST\\u2019s) [6]. Grammar rules and non-punctuation terminal symbols (i.e., any meaning-carrying tokens such as, e.g., identifiers, numbers, etc.) may be annotated with simple XML templates expressing their XML forms. Jacc may then use these templates to transform the Concrete Parse Tree (CST) into an AST of radically different structure, constructed as a jdom XML document. This yields a convenient declarative specification of a tree transduction process guided by just a few simple annotations, where Jacc\\u2019s \\u201csensible\\u201d behavior on unannotated rules and terminals works \\u201cas expected.\\u201d This greatly eases the task of retargeting the serialization of a language depending on variable or evolving XML vocabularies.\\n\\nWith Jacc, a grammar can be specified using the usual familiar yacc syntax with semantic actions specified as Java code. The format of the grammar file is essentially the same as that required by yacc, with some minor differences, and a few additional powerful features. Not using the additional features makes it essentially similar to the yacc format.\\n\\nFor the intrigued reader curious to know how one may combine dynamic operator with a static parser generator, Section 2.2 explains in some detail how Jacc extends yacc to support Prolog-style dynamic operators.\\n\\n2.2 LR-parsing with dynamic operators\\n\\nIn this section, we explain, justify, and specify the modifications that need to be made to a classical table-driven LALR(1) parser generator \\u00e0 la yacc [28]. For such a compiler generator to allow Prolog-style dynamic operators, it is necessary that it be adapted to account statically (i.e., at compile-time) for runtime information. Indeed, in Prolog, operators may be declared either at compile-time or at runtime using the built-in predicate op/3.9\\n\\nhttp://www.jdom.org/\\n\\n9 See Appendix Section A for a quick review of Prolog-style dynamic operators.\\nHow \\\\texttt{\\\\textit{\\\\textsc{jacc}}} enables static LR-parsing with dynamic operators\\n\\nIn an LR-parser such as one generated by \\\\texttt{\\\\textit{\\\\textsc{yacc}}}, precedence and associativity information is no longer available at parse-time. It is used statically at parser generation-time to resolve potential conflicts in the parser\\u2019s actions. Then, a fixed table of unambiguous actions is passed to drive the parser, which therefore always knows what to do in a given state for a given input token.\\n\\nThus, although they can recognize a much larger class of context-free languages, conventional shift-reduce parsers for LR grammars cannot accommodate parse-time ambiguity resolution. Although this makes parsing more efficient, it also forbids a parser generated by a \\\\texttt{\\\\textit{\\\\textsc{yacc}}}-like parser generator to support Prolog style operators.\\n\\nIn what follows, we propose to reorganize the structure of the implementation of a \\\\texttt{\\\\textit{\\\\textsc{yacc}}}-style parser generator to accommodate Prolog-style dynamic operators. We do so:\\n\\n- increasing the user\\u2019s convenience to define and use new syntax dynamically without changing the parser;\\n- adding new features while preserving the original \\\\texttt{\\\\textit{\\\\textsc{yacc}}} metasyntax;\\n- retaining the same efficiency as \\\\texttt{\\\\textit{\\\\textsc{yacc}}}-parsing for grammars which do not use dynamic operators;\\n- augmenting the recognizing power of bottom-up LALR parsing to languages that support dynamically (re)definable operators;\\n- making full use of the object-oriented capabilities of Java to allow the grammar specifier to tune the parser generation using user-defined classes and attributes.\\n\\nDeclaring dynamic operators\\n\\nThe first issue pertains to the way we may specify how dynamic operators are connected with the grammar\\u2019s production rules. The command:\\n\\n\\\\begin{verbatim}\\n%dynamic op\\n\\\\end{verbatim}\\n\\nis used to declare that the parser of the grammar being specified will allow defining, or redefining, dynamic operators of category \\\\texttt{op}. The effect of this declaration is to create a non-terminal symbol named \\\\texttt{op} that stands for this token category. Three implicit grammar rules are also defined:\\n\\n\\\\begin{verbatim}\\nop : 'op_' | '_op_' | '_op' ;\\n\\\\end{verbatim}\\n\\nwhich introduce, respectively, prefix, infix, and postfix, subcategories for operators of category \\\\texttt{op}. These are terminal symbols standing as generic tokens that denote specific operators for each fixity. Specific operators on category \\\\texttt{op} may be defined in the grammar specification as follows:\\n\\n\\\\begin{verbatim}\\n%op <operator> <specifier> <precedence>\\n\\\\end{verbatim}\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\n\\\\begin{verbatim}\\n%op '+' yfx 500\\n\\\\end{verbatim}\\ndeclares the symbol \\u2018+\\u2019 to be an infix binary left-associative operator of category op, with binding tightness 500, just as in Prolog.\\n\\nIn addition, the generated parser defines the following method:\\n\\n```java\\npublic final static void op ( String operator,\\n                             String specifier,\\n                             int precedence)\\n```\\n\\nwhose effect is to define, or redefine, an operator for the token category op dynamically using the given (Prolog-style) specifier and (Prolog-style) precedence. It is this method that can be invoked in a parser\\u2019s semantic action at parse time, or by the runtime environment as a static method.\\n\\nAn operator\\u2019s category name may be used in a grammar specification wherever an operator of that category is expected. Namely, it may be used in grammar rules such as:\\n\\n```plain\\nexpression : op expression\\n            | expression op\\n            | expression op expression\\n```  \\n\\nUsing the non-terminal symbol `op` in a rule such as above allows operators of any fixity declared in the op category to appear where `op` appears. However, if an occurrence must be limited to an `op` of specific fixity only, then one may use:\\n\\n- \\u2018op_\\u2019 for a prefix operator of category op;\\n- \\u2018_op\\u2019 for a postfix operator of category op;\\n- \\u2018_op_\\u2019 for an infix operator of category op.\\n\\nFor example, the above rules can be better restricted to:\\n\\n```plain\\nexpression : 'op_' expression\\n            | expression '_op'\\n            | expression '_op_' expression\\n```  \\n\\nA consequence of the above observations is that a major modification in the parser generator and the generic parser must also be made regarding the parser actions they generate for dynamic operators. A state may have contending actions on a given input. Such a state is deemed conflictual if and only if the input creating the conflict is a dynamic operator, or if one of its conflicting actions is a reduction with a rule whose tag is a dynamic operator. All other states can be treated as usual, resolving potential conflicts using the conventional method based on precedence and associativity. Clearly, a dynamic operator token category does not have this information but delegates it to the specific token, which will be known only at parse time. At parser-construction time, a pseudo-action is generated for conflictual states which delays decision until parse time. It uses the state\\u2019s table associating a set of actions with the token creating the conflict in this state. These sets of conflicting actions are thus recorded for each conflictual state.\\nWhen a token is identified and the current state is a conflictual state, which action to perform is determined by choosing in the action set associated to the state according to the same disambiguation rules followed by the static table construction but using the current precedence and associativity values of the specific operator being read. If a \\u201creduce\\u201d action in the set involves a rule tagged with a dynamic operator, which precedence and associativity values to use for the rule are those of the specific operator tag for that rule, which can be obtained in the current stack. The stack offset of that operator will depend on which of the dynamic operator\\u2019s rules is being considered.\\n\\nAmbiguous tokens Note that in general, the tokenizer may return a set of possible tokens for a single operator. Consider for example the following grammar:\\n\\n```\\n%token '!\\n%dynamic op1\\n%op1 '!' yf 200\\n%dynamic op2\\n%op2 '!' yfx 500\\n%\\nexpression : expression1 _op1_ expression1\\n            | expression2 _op2\\n            | '!' expression\\n;     \\n```\\n\\nFor this grammar, the character \\u2018!\\u2019 may be tokenized as either \\u2018!\\u2019, \\u2018op1\\u2019, or \\u2018op2\\u2019. The tokenizer can therefore be made to dispense with guaranteeing a token\\u2019s lexical category. Looking up its token category tables, the parser then determines the set of admissible lexical categories for this token in the current state (i.e., those for which it has an action defined). If more than one token remain in the set, a choice point for this state is created. Such a choice point records the current state of parsing for backtracking purposes. Namely, the grammar state, and the token set. The tokens are then tried in the order of the set, and upon error, backtracking resets the parser at the latest choice point deprived of the token that was chosen for it.\\n\\nNote that the use of backtracking for token identification is not a guarantee of complete recovery. First, full backtracking is generally not a feasible nor desirable option as it would entail possibly keeping an entire input stream in memory as the buffer grows. The option is to keep only a fixed-size buffer and flush from the choice point stack any choice point that becomes stale when this buffer overflows. In effect, this enforces an automatic commit whenever a token choice is not invalidated within the time it takes to read further tokens as allowed by the buffer size.\\n\\nSecond, although backtracking restores the parser\\u2019s state, it does not automatically undo the side effects that may have been performed by the execution of any semantic action encountered between the failure state and the restored state. If there are any, these must be undone manually. Thus, Jacc allows specifying undo actions to be executed when a rule is backtracked over.\\n\\nThe only limitation\\u2014shallow backtracking\\u2014is not serious, and in fact the choice-point stack\\u2019s size can be specified arbitrarily large if need be. Moreover, any input that\\noverruns the choice-point stack\\u2019s default depth is in fact cleaning up space by getting\\nrid of older and less-likely-to-be-used choice-points. Indeed, failure occurs generally\\nshortly after a wrong choice has been made. We give separately a more detailed speci-\\nfication of the implementation of the shallow backtracking scheme that is adequate for\\nthis purpose.\\n\\n**Token declarations** In order to declare tokens\\u2019 attributes in `yacc`, one may use the\\ncommands `%token`, `%right`, `%left`, and `%nonassoc`. These commands also give\\nthe tokens they define a precedence level according to the order of declarations, tokens\\nof equal precedence being declared in the same command. Since we wish to preserve\\ncompatibility with `yacc`\\u2019s notations and conventions, we keep these commands to have\\nthe same effect. Therefore, these commands are used as usual to declare static tokens.\\nHowever, we must explicate how the implicit precedence level of static token declara-\\ntions may coexist with the explicit precedence information specified by the Prolog-like\\ndynamic operator declarations.\\n\\nWe also wish to preserve compatibility with Prolog\\u2019s conventions. Recall that the\\nnumber argument in a Prolog \\u2018`op/3`\\u2019 declaration denotes the binding tightness of the\\noperator, which is inversely related to parsing precedence. The range of these numbers\\nis the interval `[1, 1200]`. To make this compatible with the foregoing `yacc` commands,\\nthe `<syntax>.Grammar.java` class defines two constants:\\n\\n```java\\nstatic final int MIN_PRECEDENCE = 1;\\nstatic final int MAX_PRECEDENCE = 1200;\\n```\\n\\nIn order to have the binding tightness to be such that 1200 corresponds to minimum\\nprecedence and 1 to maximum precedence, we simply define the precedence level of\\nbinding tightness `n` to be `1200 \\u2212 n + 1`. Thus, a declaration such as:\\n\\n```yaml\\n%op '+' yfx 500\\n```\\n\\nassigns to binary \\u2018+\\u2019 a precedence level of 701 (viz., `1200 \\u2212 500 + 1`).\\n\\nWe also allow dynamic operators to be declared with the form:\\n\\n```yaml\\n%op <operator> <specifier>\\n```\\n\\nleaving the precedence implicit, and defaulting to the precedence level effective at the\\ncommand\\u2019s execution time.\\n\\nThe first encountered token declaration with implicit precedence (i.e., a conven-\\ntional `yacc` token command or a two-argument dynamic operator command) uses the\\ninitial precedence level set to a default, then increments it by a fixed increment. This\\nincrement is 10 by default, but the command:\\n\\n```yaml\\n%precstep <number>\\n```\\n\\nmay be used to set the increment to the given number. This command may be used\\nseveral times. Each subsequent declaration with implicit precedence uses the current\\nprecedence level, then increments the precedence level by the current precedence incre-\\nment. Any attempt to set a precedence level outside the `[1, 1200]` range is ignored: the\\nclosest bound is used instead (i.e., 1 if less and 1200 if more), and a warning is issued.\\n\\n---\\n\\n10 This value is a system constant called `<syntax>.Grammar.MIN_PRECEDENCE`. \\n3 The Kernel Language\\n\\nA language construct is said to be primitive (or \\u201cbuilt-in\\u201d) if is not expressed in terms of other language constructs. The kernel language is the set of primitive language constructs. It is sometimes also called the \\u201cdesugared\\u201d language. This is because non-primitive constructs that are often-used combinations of primitive structures are both easier to use and read by human programmers. Hence, before being given any meaning, a program expressed using the \\u201csugared\\u201d language syntax is first translated into its equivalent \\u201cdesugared\\u201d form in the kernel language containing only primitive expressions.\\n\\n3.1 Processing a kernel expression\\n\\nFig. 1 gives the complete processing diagram from reading a \\\\((kernel).Expression\\\\) denoting a program to executing it.\\n\\n![Processing Diagram](image)\\n\\nTypically, upon being read, such a \\\\((kernel).Expression\\\\) will be:\\n\\n1. \\u201cname-sanitized\\u201d\\u2014in the context of a \\\\((kernel).Sanitizer\\\\) to discriminate between local names and global names, and establish pointers from the local variable occurrences to the abstraction that introduces them, and from global names to entries in the global symbol table;\\n2. type-checked\\u2014in the context of a \\\\((types).TypeChecker\\\\) to discover whether it has a type at all, or several possible ones (only expressions that have a unique unambiguous type are further processed);\\n\\nfootnote text:\\n\\n11 This does not mean that it could not be.

There are two kinds of ambiguities that must be \\u201csanitized:\\u201d\\n\\n- after parsing, it must be determined which identifiers are the names of local variables vs. those of global variables;\\n- after type-checking, it must be determined the runtime sort of every abstraction parameter and use this to compute the local variable environment offsets of each local variable.\\\\(^{12}\\\\)\\n\\nThus, a sanitizer is a discriminator of names and sorts.\\\\(^{13}\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\textbf{The type checker} The type checker is in fact a type inference machine that synthesizes missing type information by type unification.

Such an object serves as the common compilation context shared by an \\\\( (\\\\text{kernel}).\\\\text{Expression} \\\\) and the subexpressions comprising it. Each type of expression representing a syntactic construct of the kernel language defines a \\\\( (\\\\text{kernel}).\\\\text{Expression}.\\\\text{compile} ((\\\\text{kernel}).\\\\text{Compiler}) \\\\) method that specifies the way the construct is to be compiled in the context of a given compiler. Such a compiler object consists of attributes and methods for generating straightline code which consists of a sequence of instructions, each of specific subtype of abstract type \\\\( (\\\\text{instructions}).\\\\text{Instruction} \\\\), corresponding to a top-level expression and its subexpressions.\\n\\n\\\\(^{12}\\\\) These offsets are the so-called \\\\textit{de Bruijn} indices of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)-calculus \\\\([30]\\\\)\\u2014Or rather, their sorted version.\\n\\n\\\\(^{13}\\\\) It has occurred to this author that the word \\u201csanitizer\\u201d is perhaps a tad of a misnomer. Perhaps \\u201cdiscriminator\\u201d might have been a better choice. This also goes for the \\\\( (\\\\text{kernel}).\\\\text{Sanitizer.java} \\\\) class\\u2019 method names (i.e., \\\\text{discriminateNames} and \\\\text{discriminateSorts} rather than \\\\text{sanitizeNames} and \\\\text{sanitizeSorts}).\\nUpon completion of the compilation of a top-level expression, a resulting code array is extracted from the sequence of instructions, which may then be executed in the context of a \\\\texttt{backend}.\\\\texttt{Runtime} object, or, in the case of a \\\\texttt{kernel}.\\\\texttt{Definition}, be saved in the code array in the \\\\texttt{kernel}.\\\\texttt{Definition}'s \\\\texttt{kernel}.\\\\texttt{codeEntry()} field of type \\\\texttt{(types).DefinedEntry}, which is an object that encapsulates its code entry point, and which may in turn then be used to access the defined symbol's code for execution.\\n\\nEach expression construct of the kernel must therefore specify a compiling rule. Such a rule expresses how the abstract syntax construct maps into a straight-line code sequence.\\n\\nIn Appendix Section B, this process is illustrated in more detail on a few typical as well as less typical expressions.\\n\\n4 Types\\n\\nWe have illustrated a style of programming based on the use of rich type systems. This is not new in general, but the particularly rich type system we have described, based on type quantifiers and subtypes, extends the state of the art. This rich type structure can account for functional, imperative, algebraic, and object-oriented programming in a unified framework, and extends to programming in the large and, with care, to system programming.\\n\\n\\\\textmd{LUCA CARDELLI\\u2014\\\"Typeful Programming\\\" \\\\cite{cardelli1998}}\\n\\n4.1 Type language\\n\\nWe first define some basic terminology regarding the type system and operations on types.\\n\\n\\\\textbf{Polymorphism} Here, by \\\"polymorphism,\\\" we mean ML-polymorphism (i.e., 2nd-order universal), with a few differences that will be explained along the way. The syntax of types is defined with a grammar such as:\\n\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n  \\\\item \\\\texttt{Type} ::= \\\\texttt{SimpleType} | \\\\texttt{TypeScheme}\\n  \\\\item \\\\texttt{SimpleType} ::= \\\\texttt{BasicType} | \\\\texttt{FunctionType} | \\\\texttt{TypeParameter}\\n  \\\\item \\\\texttt{BasicType} ::= \\\\texttt{Int} | \\\\texttt{Real} | \\\\texttt{Boolean} | ... \\\\item \\\\texttt{FunctionType} ::= \\\\texttt{SimpleType} \\\\rightarrow \\\\texttt{SimpleType}\\n  \\\\item \\\\texttt{TypeParameter} ::= \\\\alpha | \\\\alpha' | ... | \\\\beta | \\\\beta' | ... \\\\item \\\\texttt{TypeScheme} ::= \\\\forall \\\\texttt{TypeParameter} . \\\\texttt{Type}\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nthat ensures that universal type quantifiers occur only at the outset of a polymorphic type.\\\\footnote{Or more precisely that \\\\(\\\\forall\\\\) never occurs nested inside a function type arrow \\\\(\\\\rightarrow\\\\). This apparently innocuous detail ensures decidability of type inference. BTW, the 2nd order comes from the\\n**Multiple type overloading** This is also often called *ad hoc* polymorphism. When enabled (the default), this allows a same identifier to have several unrelated types. Generally, it is restricted to names with functional types. However, since functions are first-class citizens, this restriction makes no sense, and therefore the default is to enable multiple type overloading for all types.\\n\\nTo this author\\u2019s knowledge, there is no established prevailing technology for supporting both ML-polymorphic type inference and multiple type overloading. So here, as in a few other parts of this overall design, I have had to innovate. I essentially implemented a type proving logic using techniques from (Constraint) Logic Programming in order to handle the combination of types supportable by this architecture.\\n\\n**Currying** Currying is an operation that exploits the following mathematical isomorphism of types:\\\\(^{15}\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\[\\nT, T' \\\\rightarrow T'' \\\\simeq T \\\\rightarrow (T' \\\\rightarrow T'')\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhich can be generalized for a function type of any number of arguments to any of its multiple curryed forms\\u2014i.e., for all \\\\(k = 1, \\\\ldots, n - 1\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[\\nT_1, \\\\ldots, T_n \\\\rightarrow T \\\\simeq T_1, \\\\ldots, T_k \\\\rightarrow (T_{k+1}, \\\\ldots, T_n \\\\rightarrow T)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWhen function currying is enabled, this means that type-checking/inference must build this equational theory into the type unification rules in order to consider types equal modulo this isomorphism.\\n\\n**Standardizing** As a result of, e.g., currying, the shape of a function type may change in the course of a type-checking/inference process. Type comparison may thus be tested on various structurally different, although syntactically congruent, forms of a same type. A type must therefore assume a canonical form in order to be compared. This is what standardizing a type does.\\n\\nStandardizing is a two-phase operation that first flattens the domains of function types, then renames the type parameters. The flattening phase simply amounts to un-currying as much as possible by applying Equation (1) as a rewrite rule, although backwards (i.e., from right to left) as long as it applies. The second phase (renaming) consists in making a consistent copy of all types reachable from a type\\u2019s root.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\\\(^{15}\\\\) For the intrigued reader curious to know what deep connection there might be between functional types and Indian cooking, the answer is, \\u201cNone whatsoever!\\u201d The word was coined after Prof. Haskell B. Curry\\u2019s last name. Curry was one of the two mathematicians/logicians (along with Robert Feys) who conceived *Combinator Logic* and *Combinator Calculus*, and made extensive use of the isomorphism of Equation (1)\\u2014hence the folklore\\u2019s use of the verb to curry\\u2014(*currying, curryed*),\\u2014 in French: *curryfier*\\u2014(*curryfication, curryfi\\u00e9*), to mean transforming a function type of several arguments into that of a function of one argument. The homonymy is often amusingly mistaken for an exotic way of [un]spicing functions.\\nCopying  Copying a type is simply taking a duplicate twin of the graph reachable from\\nthe type\\u2019s root. Sharing of pointers coming from the fact that type parameters co-occur\\nare recorded in a parameter substitution table (in our implementation, simply a java.-\\nutil.HashMap) along the way, and thus consistent pointer sharing can be easily\\nmade effective.\\n\\nEquality  Testing for equality must be done modulo a parameter substitution table (in\\nour implementation, simply a java.util.HashMap) that records pointer equalities\\nalong the way, and thus equality up to parameter renaming can be easily made effective.\\n\\nA tableless version of equality also exists for which each type parameter is consid-\\nered equal only to itself.\\n\\nUnifying  Unifying two types is the operation of filling in missing information (i.e.,\\ntype parameters) in each with existing information from the other by side-effecting\\n(i.e., binding) the missing information (i.e., the type parameters) to point to the part\\nof the existing information from the other type they should be equal to (i.e., their values).\\nNote that, like logical variables in Logic Programming, type parameters can be bound\\nto one another and thus must be dereferenced to their values.\\n\\nBoxing/unboxing  The kernel language is polymorphically typed. Therefore, a function\\nexpression that has a polymorphic type must work for all instantiations of this type\\u2019s\\ntype parameters into either primitive unboxed types (e.g., Int, Real, etc.) or boxed\\ntypes. The problem this poses is: how can we compile a polymorphic function into\\ncode that would correctly know what the actual runtime sorts of the function\\u2019s runtime\\narguments and returned value are, before the function type is actually instantiated into\\na (possibly monomorphic) type? This problem was addressed by Xavier Leroy and\\nhe proposed a solution, which has been implemented in the CAML compiler [32].\\nLeroy\\u2019s method is based on the use of type annotation that enables a source-to-source\\ntransformation. This source transformation is the automatic generation of wrappers and\\nunwrappers for boxing and unboxing expressions whenever necessary. After that, com-\\npiling the transformed source as usual will be guaranteed to be correct on all types.\\n\\nFor our purpose, the main idea from Leroy\\u2019s solution was adapted and improved so\\nthat:\\n\\n\\u2013 the type annotation and rules are greatly simplified;\\n\\u2013 no source-to-source transformation is needed;\\n\\u2013 un/wrappers generation is done at code-generation time.\\n\\nThis saves a great amount of space and time.\\n\\n16 The alternative would be either to compile distinct copies for all possible runtime sort instan-\\ntiations (like, e.g., C++ template functions), or compiling each specific instantiation as it is\\nneeded. The former is not acceptable because it tends to inflate the code space explosively.\\nThe latter can neither be envisaged because it goes against a few (rightfully) sacrosanct prin-\\nciples like separate compilation and abstract library interfacing\\u2014imagine having to recompile\\na library everytime you want to use it!\\n17 See http://caml.inria.fr/.\\n4.2 Type processing\\n\\nThe type system consists of two complementary parts: a static and a dynamic part. The former takes care of verifying all type constraints that are statically decidable (i.e., before actually running the program). The latter pertains to type constraints that must wait until execution time to decide whether those (involving runtime values) may be decided. This is called dynamic type-checking and is best seen (and conceived) as an incremental extension of the static part.\\n\\nA type is either a static type, or a dynamic type. A static type is a type that is checked before runtime by the type-checker. A dynamic type is a wrapper around a type that may need additional runtime information in order to be fully verified. Its static part must be (and is!) checked statically by the static type checker, but the compiler may complete this by issuing runtime tests at appropriate places in the code it generates; namely, when:\\n\\n- binding abstraction parameters of this type in an application, or\\n- assigning to local and global variable of this type, or\\n- updating an array slot, a tuple component, or an object\\u2019s field, of this type.\\n\\nThere are two kinds of dynamic types:\\n\\n- Extensional types\\u2014defined with explicit extensions (either statically provided or dynamically computed runtime values):\\n  - `Set` extension type;\\n  - `Int` range extension type (close interval of integers);\\n  - `Real` range extension type (close interval of floating-point numbers).\\n  A special kind of set of `Int` type is used to define enumeration types (from actual symbol sets) through opaque type definitions.\\n- Intensional types\\u2014defined using any runtime Boolean condition to be checked at runtime, calls to which are tests generated statically; e.g., non-negative numbers (i.e., `int+`, `double+`).\\n\\nStatic types The static type system is the part of the type system that is effective at compile-time.\\n\\nPrimitive types\\n\\n- `Boxable` types (`Void`, `Int`, `Real`, `Char`, and `Boolean`)\\n- `Boxed` types (i.e., boxed versions of `Boxable` types or non-primitive types)\\n\\nNon-primitive types\\n\\n- Built-in type constants (e.g., `String`, etc., \\u2026)\\n- Type constructors\\n- Function types\\n- Tuple types:\\n  - Position tuple types\\n\\n18 For the complete class hierarchy of types in the package `(design).types`, see Fig. 2.\\n- Named tuple types\\n- Array types:\\n  - 0-based int-indexed arrays\\n  - Int range-indexed arrays\\n  - Set-indexed arrays\\n  - Multidimensional arrays\\n- Collection types \\\\((\\\\text{Set}(\\\\alpha), \\\\text{Bag}(\\\\alpha), \\\\text{List}(\\\\alpha))\\\\).\\n- Class types\\n\\n**The Class type** This is the type of object structures. It declares an interface (or member type signature) for a class of objects and the members comprising its structure. It holds information for compiling field access and update, and enables specifying an implementation for methods manipulating objects of this type.\\n\\nA class implementation uses the information declared in its interface. It is interpreted as follows: only non-method members\\u2014hereafter called fields\\u2014correspond to actual slots in an object structure that is an instance of the class and thus may be updated. On the other hand, all members (i.e., both fields and method members) are defined as global functions whose first argument stands for the object itself (that may be referred to as \\u2018this\\u2019).\\n\\nThe syntax we shall use for a class definition is of the form:\\n\\n```plaintext\\nclass classname { interface } [{ implementation }]\\n```\\n\\nThe interface block specifies the type signatures of the members (fields and methods) of the class and possibly initial values for fields. The implementation block is optional and gives the definition of (some or all of) the methods.\\n\\nFor example, one can declare a class to represent a simple counter as follows:\\n\\n```plaintext\\nclass Counter {\\n  value: Int = 1;\\n  method set: Int \\u2192 Counter;\\n\\n  set(value: Int) : Counter\\n  = (this.value = value);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe first block specifies the interface for the class type Counter defining two members: a field `value` of type `Int` and a method `set` taking an argument of type `Int` and returning a `Counter` object. It also specifies an initialization expression (1) for the `value` field. Specifying a field\\u2019s initialization is optional\\u2014when missing, the field will be initialized to a null value of appropriate type: 0 for an `Int`, 0.0 for a `Real`, `false` for a `Boolean`, `'\\\\000'` for a `Char`, `\\\"\\\"` for a `String`, `void` for `Void`, and `nullT` for any other type `T`. The implementation block for the Counter class defines the body of the `set` method. Note that a method\\u2019s implementation can also be given outside the class.\\n\\n---\\n\\n19 Strictly speaking, a field of type `Void` is useless since it can only have the unique value of this type (i.e., `void`). Thus, a `void` field should arguably be disallowed. On the other hand, allowing it is not semantically unsound and may be tolerated for the sake of uniformity.\\ndeclaration as a function whose first argument\\u2019s type is the class. For example, we could have defined the `set` method of the class `Counter` as:\\n\\n```python\\ndef set(x: Counter, n: Int): Counter = (x.value = n);\\n```\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nOn the other hand, although a field is also semantically a function whose first argument\\u2019s type is a class, it may not be defined outside its class. Defining a declared field outside a class declaration causes an error. This is because the code of a field is always fixed and defined to return the value of an object\\u2019s slot corresponding to the field. Note however that one may define a unary function whose argument is a class type outside this class when it is not a declared field for this class. It will be understood as a `method` for the class (even though it takes no extra argument and may be invoked in \\\"dot notation\\\" without parentheses as a field is) and thus act as a \\\"static field\\\" for the class. Of course field updates using dot notation will not be allowed on these pseudo fields. However, they (like any global variable) may be (re)set using a global (re)definition at the top level, or a nested global assignment.\\n\\nNote also that a field may be functional without being a method\\u2014the essential difference being that a field is part of the structure of every object instance of a class and thus may be updated within an object instance, while a method is common to all instances of a class and may not be updated within a particular instance, but only globally for all the class\\u2019 instances.\\n\\nThus, every time a `Counter` object is created with `new`, as in, for example:\\n\\n```python\\nc = new Counter;\\n```\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nthe slot that corresponds to the location of the `value` field will be initialized to the value 1 of type `Int`. Then, field and method invocation can be done using the familiar \\u201cdot notation;\\u201d viz.:\\n\\n```python\\nc.set(c.value + 2);\\nwrite(c.value);\\n```\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nThis will set `c`\\u2019s `value` field to 3 and print out this value. This code is exactly equivalent to:\\n\\n```python\\nset(c, value(c) + 2);\\nwrite(value(c));\\n```\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nIndeed, field and method invocation simply amounts to functional application. This scheme offers the advantage that an object\\u2019s fields and methods may be manipulated as functions (i.e., as first-class citizens) and no additional setup is needed for type-checking and/or type inference when it comes to objects.\\n\\nIncidentally, some or all type information may be omitted while specifying a class\\u2019s `implementation` (though not its `interface`) as long as non-ambiguous types may be inferred. Thus, the implementation block for the class `Counter` in class definition (4) could be specified more simply as:\\n\\n```python\\n{ set(n) = (value = n); }\\n```\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nDeclaring a class type and defining its implementation causes the following:\\n- the name of the class is entered with a new type for it in the type table (an object comprising symbol tables, of type \\\\(\\\\langle\\\\)\\\\text{types}\\\\rangle.\\\\text{Tables.java}\\\\); this ensures that its type definition links it to an appropriate \\\\text{ClassType} object; namely, a class structure represented by an object of type \\\\(\\\\langle\\\\)\\\\text{types}\\\\rangle.\\\\text{ClassInfo.java}\\\\) where the code entries for all its members\\u2019 types are recorded;\\n- each field of a distinct type is assigned an offset in an array of slots (per sort);\\n- each method and field expression is name-sanitized, type-checked, and sort-sanitized after closing it into an abstraction taking \\\\(\\\\text{this}\\\\) as first argument;\\n- each method definition is then compiled into a global definition, and each field is compiled into a global function corresponding to accessing its value from the appropriate offset;\\n- finally, each field\\u2019s initialization expression is compiled and recorded in an object of type \\\\text{ClassType} to be used at object creation time. An object may be created at run-time (using the \\\\text{new} operator followed by a class name).\\n\\nThe type system\\n\\nFig. 2 shows the hierarchy of Java classes representing the categories of types currently comprising the type system. The classes represented in boxes are abstract classes. There could be more, of course.\\n\\nStructure of \\\\text{TypeChecker}\\n\\nAn object of the class \\\\(\\\\langle\\\\)\\\\text{types}\\\\rangle.\\\\text{TypeChecker.java}\\\\) is a backtracking prover that establishes various kinds of goals. The most common goal kind established by a type checker is a typing goal\\u2014but there are others.\\n\\nA \\\\(\\\\langle\\\\)\\\\text{types}\\\\rangle.\\\\text{TypingGoal} object is a pair consisting of an expression and a type. Proving a typing goal amounts to unifying its expression component\\u2019s type with its type component. Such goals are spawned by the type checking method of expressions as per their type checking rules.\\\\(^\\\\text{20}\\\\) Some globally defined symbols having multiple types, it is necessary to keep choices of these and backtrack to alternative types upon failure. Thus, a \\\\text{TypeChecker} object maintains all the necessary structures for undoing the effects that happened since the last choice point. These effects are:\\n\\n1. type variable binding,\\n2. function type currying,\\n3. application expression currying.\\n\\nIn addition, it is also necessary to remember all \\\\text{Goal} objects that were proven since the last choice point in order to prove them anew upon backtracking to an alternative choice. This is necessary because the goals are spawned by calls to the \\\\text{typeCheck} method of expressions that may be exited long before a failure occurs. Then, all the original typing goals that were spawned in the mean time since the current choice point\\u2019s goal must be reestablished. In order for this to work, any choice points that were associated to these original goals must also be recovered. To enable this, when a choice point is created for a \\\\(\\\\langle\\\\)\\\\text{kernel}\\\\rangle.\\\\text{Global} symbol, choices are linked in the reverse order (i.e., ending in the original goal) to enable reinstating all choices that were tried for this goal.\\n\\n\\\\(^{20}\\\\) See Appendix Section B.\\nClass hierarchy of types in the package\\nhl.linalg.desig.types\\n\\nFig. 2. The type system\\u2014Metaclass Heirarchy\\nThis amounts to the on-the-fly compiling of type-checking rules into \\u201ctyping-goal\\u201d instructions that must be stored for potential retrial upon subsequent failure.

Type definitions are provided both for (1) convenience of making programs more legible by giving terser \\u201clogical\\u201d names (or terms) to otherwise verbose type expressions, and (2) that of hiding information details of a\\ntype and making it act as a new type altogether. The former facility is that of providing aliases to types (exactly like a preprocessor\\u2019s macros get expanded right away into their textual equivalents), while the latter offers the convenience of defining new types in terms of existing ones, but hiding this information. It follows from this distinction that a type alias is always structurally equivalent to its value (in fact an alias disappears as soon as it is read in, being parsed away into the structure defining it). By contrast, a defined type is never structurally equivalent to its value nor any other type\\u2014it is only equivalent to itself. To enable meaningful computation with a defined type, two meta-(de/con)structors are thus provided: one for explicitly casting a defined type into the type that defines it, and one explicitly seeing a type as a specified defined type (if such a defined type does exist and with this type as definition).\\n\\nThe class `{types}.Tables.java` contains the symbol tables for global names and types. The name spaces of the identifiers denoting type and non-type (global or local) names (which are kept in the global symbol table) are disjoint\\u2014so there are no name conflicts between types and non-type identifiers.\\n\\nThe `{types}.Tables.java.typeTable` variable contains the naming table for types and the `{types}.Tables.java.symbolTable` variable contains the naming table for other (non-type) global names.\\n\\nThis section will overview some type-related data-structures starting from the class that manages symbols: `{types}.Tables.java`. The names can be those of types and values. They are global names.21 The type namespace is independent of the value namespace\\u2014i.e., the same name can denote a value and a type.\\n\\n**Dynamic types** Dynamic types are to be checked, if possible statically (at least their static part is), at least in two particular places of an expression. Namely,\\n\\n- at assignment/update time; and,\\n- at (function) parameter-binding time.\\n\\nThis will ensure that the actual value placed in the slot expecting a certain type does respect additional constraints that may only be verified with some runtime values. Generally, as soon as a type\\u2019s structure depends on a runtime value, it is necessarily a dynamic type. These are also often referred to as dependent types. For example, `array_of_size(int n)`, where `n` is the size of the array and is a runtime value. It denotes a \\u201csafe\\u201d array type depending on the array size that may be only computed at runtime.22 From this, we require that a class implementing the `DynamicType` interface provides a method:\\n\\n```\\npublic boolean verifyCondition ()\\n```\\n\\nthat is invoked systematically by code generated for dynamically typed function parameters and for locations that are the target of updates (i.e., array slot update, object field update, tuple field update) at compilation of abstractions and various assignment constructs. Of this class, three subclasses derive their properties:\\n\\n---\\n\\n21 At the moment, there is no name qualification or namespace management. When this service is provided, it will also be through the `{types}.Tables.java` class.\\n\\n22 e.g., \\u00e0 la Java arrays.\\n- extensional types;\\n- Boolean-assertion types;\\n- non-negative number types.\\n\\nWe shall consider here a few such dynamic types (motivated essentially by the typing needs of for OPL, or similar constraint languages [26]). Namely,\\n\\n- extensional types;\\n- intensional types (e.g., non-negative numbers)\\n\\nAn extensional type is a type whose elements are determined to be members of a predetermined and fixed extension (i.e., any runtime value that denotes a collection\\u2014such as a set, an integer range, a floating-point number range, or an enumeration). Such types pose the additional problem of being usable at compile-time to restrict the domains of other variables. However, some of those variables\\u2019 values may only fully be determined at runtime. These particular dynamic types have therefore a simple verifyCondition() method that is automatically run as soon as the extension is known. This method simply verifies that the element is a bona fide member of the extension. Otherwise, it relies on a more complicated scheme based on the notion of contract. Basically, a contract-based type is an extensional type that does not have an extension (as yet) but already carries the obligation that some particular individual constants be part of their extensions. Those elements constitute \\u201ccontracts\\u201d that must be honored as soon as the type\\u2019s extension becomes known (either positively\\u2014removing the honored contract; or, negatively\\u2014causing a type error).\\n\\nExtensional types that have been included are set types, range types (integer and floating-point), and enumeration types. Other dynamic types could of course be added as needed (e.g., lists, bags, etc.).\\n\\nIntensional types can be accommodated by defining new opaque types\\u2014e.g., in order to define non-negative numbers, we introduce a new (opaque) type Nat as a dynamically constrained Int type whose verifyCondition method ensures that only non-negative integer values may be used for this type.\\n\\n5 Computing with Collections\\n\\nThere are two classes defined for such expressions: (kernel).Homomorphism.java and (kernel).Comprehension.java. These classes are based on the formal notion of monoid homomorphisms and comprehension as defined in query-language formalisms [14,15,13,22].\\n\\nThese two classes of expressions use monoid homomorphisms as declarative iterators. Thus, henceforth, by homomorphism we mean specifically monoid homomorphism. For our purposes, a monoid is a set of data values or structures (i.e., a data type) endowed with an associative binary operation and an identity element. Examples are given in Fig. 4. Monoid homomorphisms are quite useful for expressing a certain kind of iteration declaratively.\\n\\n---\\n\\n23 See Appendix Section E for a refresher on monoid homomorphisms and comprehensions.\\nThe class Homomorphism is the class of objects denoting (monoid) homomorphisms. An instance of such a class defines all the needed parameters for representing and iterating through a collection, applying a function to each element, accumulating the results along the way with an operation, and returning the end result. More precisely, it is the built-in version of the general computation scheme whose instance is the following \\u201chom\\u201d functional, which may be formulated recursively, for the case of a list collection, as:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{hom}_{\\\\oplus}(f)[H | T] = f(H) \\\\oplus \\\\text{hom}_{\\\\oplus}(f)T\\n\\\\]\\n\\nClearly, this scheme extends a function \\\\( f \\\\) to a homomorphism of monoids, from the monoid of lists to the monoid defined by \\\\( \\\\langle \\\\oplus, 1_\\\\oplus \\\\rangle \\\\).\\n\\nThus, an object of this class denotes the result of applying such a homomorphic extension of a function \\\\( f \\\\) to an element of collection monoid (i.e., a data structure such as a set, a list, or a bag), the image monoid being implicitly defined by the binary operation \\\\( \\\\oplus \\\\)\\u2014also called the accumulation operation. It is made to work iteratively.\\n\\nFor technical reasons, we need to treat specially so-called collection homomorphisms; i.e., those whose accumulation operation constructs a collection, such as a set. Although a collection homomorphism can conceptually be expressed with the general scheme, the function applied to an element of the collection will return a collection (i.e., a free monoid) element, and the result of the homomorphism is then the result of tallying the partial collections coming from applying the function to each element into a final \\u201cconcatenation.\\u201d\\nOther (non-collection) homomorphisms are called \\\\textit{primitive} homomorphisms. For those, the function applied to all elements of the collection will return a \\\\textit{computed} element that may be directly composed with the other results. Thus, the difference between the two kinds of (collection or primitive) homomorphisms will appear in the typing and the code generated (collection homomorphism requiring an extra loop for tallying partial results into the final collection). It is easy to make the distinction between the two kinds of homomorphisms thanks to the type of the accumulation operation (see below).\\n\\nTherefore, a \\\\textit{collection homomorphism} expression constructing a collection of type $coll(T)$ consists of:\\n\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n  \\\\item the collection iterated over\\u2014of type $coll'(T')$;\\n  \\\\item the iterated function applied to each element\\u2014of type $T' \\\\rightarrow coll(T)$; and,\\n  \\\\item the operation \\u201cadding\\u201d an element to a collection\\u2014of type $T, coll(T) \\\\rightarrow coll(T)$.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nA \\\\textit{primitive homomorphism} computing a value of type $T$ consists of:\\n\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n  \\\\item the collection iterated over\\u2014of type $coll'(T')$;\\n  \\\\item the iterated function applied to each element\\u2014of type $T' \\\\rightarrow T$; and,\\n  \\\\item the monoid operation\\u2014of type $T, T \\\\rightarrow T$.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nEven though the scheme of computation for homomorphisms described above is correct, it is not often used, especially when the function already encapsulates the accumulation operation, as is always the case when the homomorphism comes from the desugaring of a \\\\textit{comprehension}\\u2014(see below). Then, such a homomorphism will directly side-effect the collection structure specified as the identity element with a function of the form $\\\\text{fun } x \\\\cdot x \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{1}$ (i.e., adding element $x$ to the collection) and dispense altogether with the need to accumulate intermediate results. We shall call those homomorphisms \\\\textit{in-place} homomorphisms. To distinguish them and enable the suppression of intermediate computations, a flag indicating that the homomorphism is to be computed in-place is provided. Both primitive and collection homomorphisms can be specified to be in-place. If nothing regarding in-place computation is specified for a homomorphism, the default behavior will depend on whether the homomorphism is collection (default is in-place), or primitive (default is \\\\textit{not} in-place). Methods to override the defaults are provided.\\n\\nFor an in-place homomorphism, the iterated function encapsulates the operation, which affects the identity element, which thus accumulates intermediate results and no further composition using the operation is needed. This is especially handy for collections that are often represented, for (space and time) efficiency reasons, by iterable bulk structures constructed by allocating an empty structure that is filled in-place with elements using a built-in \\\\textit{add} method guaranteeing that the resulting data structure is canonical\\u2014i.e., that it abides by the algebraic properties of its type of collection (e.g., adding an element to a set will not create duplicates, etc.).\\n\\nAlthough monoid homomorphisms are defined as expressions in the kernel, they are not meant to be represented directly in a surface syntax (although they could, but would lead to rather cumbersome and not very legible expressions). Rather, they are meant to be used for expressing higher-level expressions known as \\\\textit{monoid comprehensions}, which offer the advantage of the familiar (set) comprehension notation used in\\nmathematics, and can be translated into monoid homomorphisms to be type-checked and evaluated. This is what the kernel class \\\\textbf{Comprehension} encapsulates, as it is defined relying on the class \\\\textbf{Homomorphism}, exactly as its formal definition does.\\n\\nA monoid comprehension is an expression of the form:\\n\\n$$\\\\langle \\\\oplus, 1 \\\\rangle \\\\{ e \\\\mid q_1, \\\\ldots, q_n \\\\}$$\\n\\nwhere \\\\( \\\\langle \\\\oplus, 1 \\\\rangle \\\\) define a monoid, \\\\( e \\\\) is an expression, and the \\\\( q_j \\\\)'s are \\\\textit{qualifiers}. A qualifier is either an expression \\\\( e \\\\) or a pair \\\\( x \\\\leftarrow e \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a variable and \\\\( e \\\\) is an expression. The sequence of qualifiers may also be empty. Such a monoid comprehension is just syntactic sugar that can be expressed in terms of homomorphisms as follows:\\n\\n$$\\\\langle \\\\oplus, 1 \\\\rangle \\\\{ e \\\\mid \\\\} \\\\equiv e \\\\oplus 1$$\\n\\n$$\\\\langle \\\\oplus, 1 \\\\rangle \\\\{ e \\\\mid x \\\\leftarrow e', Q \\\\} \\\\equiv \\\\text{hom}_{\\\\langle \\\\oplus, 1 \\\\rangle}^\\\\mathbb{P} [\\\\lambda x. \\\\langle \\\\oplus, 1 \\\\rangle \\\\{ e \\\\mid Q \\\\}](e')$$\\n\\n$$\\\\langle \\\\oplus, 1 \\\\rangle \\\\{ e \\\\mid e, Q \\\\} \\\\equiv \\\\text{if} e \\\\text{ then } \\\\langle \\\\oplus, 1 \\\\rangle \\\\{ e \\\\mid Q \\\\} \\\\text{ else } 1$$\\n\\nIn other words, a comprehension is fully expressible in terms of compositions of homomorphisms. Comprehensions are also interesting as they may be subject to transformations leading to more efficient evaluation than their simple \\u201cnested loops\\u201d operational semantics (by using \\u201cunnesting\\u201d techniques and using relational operations as implementation instructions [39,21]).\\n\\nAlthough a monoid comprehension can be effectively computed using nested loops (i.e., using a simple iteration semantics), such would be in general rather inefficient. Rather, an optimized implementation can be achieved by various syntactic transformation expressed as rewrite rules. Thus, the principal benefit of using monoid comprehensions is to formulate efficient optimizations on a simple and uniform general syntax of expressions irrespective of specific monoids [14,15,39,13,21]. All the attributes of the syntax of monoid comprehensions derived from monoid homomorphisms are represented in these type classes.\\n\\nThus, monoid comprehensions allow the formulation of \\u201cdeclarative iteration.\\u201d Note the fact mentioned earlier that a homomorphism coming from the translation of a comprehension encapsulates the operation in its function. Thus, this is generally taken to advantage with operations that cause a side-effect on their second argument to enable an in-place homomorphism to dispense with unneeded intermediate computation.\\n\\n\\\\section{Conclusion}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Recapitulation}\\n\\nIn this document we summarized the main characteristics of an abstract, reusable, and extensible programming language architecture, and its implementation in Java. We overviewed original generic syntax-processing tools that have been conceived, implemented, and used to ease the experimental front-end development for language processing systems. This consisted of \\\\texttt{Jacc}, a flexible metacompiler all done in 100\\\\%-pure Java. We explained the machinery needed to extend LALR-parsing to enable dynamic operators \\u00e0 la Prolog. We gave a high-level description of the architectural attributes of a set\\nof kernel classes of programming language constructs and how they are processed for typing, compiling, and executing. We presented our architecture general processing diagram taking a kernel expression into straightline abstract-machine code. We discussed a type system that is the basis for a polymorphic type inference abstract machine enabling multiple-type overloading, type encapsulation, object-orientation, and type (un)boxing analysis. We described the type language primitives and constructors, and how they were analyzed for efficient code generation and execution. We explained our implementation of type-checking and how execution of declarative iteration over collections may be specified using the notion of monoid homomorphism and comprehension as used in object-oriented database query languages to generate efficient collection-processing code.\\n\\nFor the sake of making this document self-contained, we append below a set of sections of tutorial nature giving background material and finer-point discussions regarding what was presented.\\n\\n6.2 What\\u2019s next?\\n\\nThis architecture offers a compromise between formal executable specification systems (e.g., [38,10]) and pragmatic needs for practical language prototyping backward compatible with popular existing tools (yacc, Java), while staying an extensible system\\u2014a poor man\\u2019s language kit? . . . It enables fast and low-cost development of programming languages with basic and advanced features using familiar programming idioms like yacc and Java with a relatively high efficiency and confidence of correctness.\\n\\nImportantly, it is open and favors ease of extension as well as interoperability with popular representation standards such as the W3C\\u2019s. As mentioned several times, and made explicit in the title, this work is to be continued. Indeed, more tools and capabilities are to be added as this author\\u2019s sees the need. The system has shown itself a practical and useful experimental tool. However, much more remains to be done (e.g., namespace and access management, rule-based programming, logic programming, finer type logics, etc., . . . ). Here are a few of the most immediate on our agenda.\\n\\n\\u2013 Notation\\u2014The next step is to extend Jacc by providing other structure-generating options besides XML, such as the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)24 and its version for Linked Data (JSON-LD).25 With this tool, it will then be easier to experiment using Jacc to generate RDF-triples (or variations thereof) as compilation schemes from high-level (i.e., more legible and user-friendly) KR languages (such as, e.g., OSF or LIFE syntax\\u2014or even higher level; e.g., NL dialects).\\n\\n\\u2013 Typing\\u2014Truly polymorphic object-oriented subtyping \\u00e0 la Gesberg, et al. [23,24], or Satisfiability Modulo Theories \\u00e0 la Bierman et al. [10,11]. This is indeed a most desired set of type-analytical capabilities to enable subtyping and class inheritance in our type logic. The type-checking rules given for these systems are the best candidates to use for this objective.\\n\\n24 [http://www.json.org/](http://www.json.org/)\\n\\n25 [http://json-ld.org/](http://json-ld.org/)\\n\\u2013 *Semantics*\\u2014 The most ambitious next step in terms of semantics, would be to extend the current design with additional abstract meta-constructs for $L^P$ [3] and $CLP$ [27] (and LIFE [4,7] in particular).\\n\\n\\u2013 *Pragmatics*\\u2014 Not much has been said about the backend system. Among the most desired to be done is a graphical front end based on Eclipse. Wrapping all the backend tools and services in such a front-end would greatly help further meta-development.\\n\\n\\u2013 *Implementation*\\u2014 Once abstracted into stable interfaces, any design may then be made more efficient where needed since implementation has thus been made independent. Attention may then be safely given to clever optimization of any type of algorithms used in the implementation of these interfaces, relying on time-tested techniques [1].\\n\\n**Appendix**\\n\\nIn order to make this article self-contained, we include next a set of tutorials that overview essential background notions. Thus, this appendix consists of the following sections. Section A recalls the peculiar way that Prolog uses to enable changing the syntactic properties of its operators dynamically\\u2014i.e., at run time. Section B describes how a few familiar programming language constructs may be specified as classes of objects and how these classes are processed in various syntax, typing, or execution contexts. Section C recounts notions on algebraic monoids. Section D is a reminder of the abstract syntax and type inference logic for a basic typed polymorphic $\\\\lambda$-calculus with tupling. Section E presents OQL, an Object Query Language extending this basic $\\\\lambda$-calculus into a monoid comprehension calculus dealing with collection data in a declarative manner thanks to monoid homomorphisms. Section F is a brief specification of the backend tooling needed to complete the system.\\n\\n### A Prolog-style Dynamic Operators\\n\\nIn Prolog, the built-in operator `$op/3$\\u2019 offers the user the means to declare or modify the syntax of some of its operators. For example, as will be explained below:\\n\\n```\\n?- op(500, yfx, +).\\n```\\n\\ndeclares the symbol \\u2018+\\u2019 to be an infix binary left-associative operator with binding tightness 500. The second argument of the built-in predicate $op/3$ is called the operator\\u2019s specifier. It is a symbol that encodes three kinds of information concerning the operator; namely:\\n\\n\\u2013 arity (*unary* or *binary*),\\n\\u2013 \\u201cfixity\\u201d (*prefix*, *infix*, or *postfix*),\\n\\u2013 associativity (*left-*-, *right-* , or *non-associative.*).\\n\\n---\\n\\n26 See Appendix Section F\\n27 http://www.eclipse.org/\\nThe specifier is an identifier consisting of either two or three of the letters \\u2018f\\u2019, \\u2018x\\u2019, and \\u2018y\\u2019, which are interpreted as follows. The letter \\u2018f\\u2019 stands for the operator\\u2019s position in an expression (its fixity), and the letters \\u2018x\\u2019 and \\u2018y\\u2019 stand for the arguments\\u2019 positions. These letters are mnemonics for \\u201cfunctor,\\u201d (\\u2018f\\u2019) \\u201cyes,\\u201d (\\u2018y\\u2019) and \\u201cno\\u201d (\\u2018x\\u2019). A \\u2018y\\u2019 occurring on the left (resp., right) of \\u2018f\\u2019, means that the operator associates to the left (resp., right). An \\u2018x\\u2019 occurring on the left (resp., right) of \\u2018f\\u2019, means that the operator does not associate to the left (resp., right). Thus, the possible operator specifiers are shown in Table 1.\\\\(^{28}\\\\)\\n\\n| Specifier | Arity  | Fixity          | Associativity |\\n|-----------|--------|-----------------|---------------|\\n| fx        | unary  | prefix          | non-associative|\\n| fy        | unary  | prefix          | right-associative|\\n| xf        | unary  | postfix         | non-associative|\\n| yf        | unary  | postfix         | left-associative|\\n| xfix      | binary | infix           | non-associative|\\n| xfy       | binary | infix           | right-associative|\\n| yfx       | binary | infix           | left-associative|\\n\\nTable 1. Mnemonic operator specifiers in Prolog\\n\\nThe binding tightness used by Prolog\\u2019s `op/3` works in fact as the opposite of the precedence level used in parsing: the smaller a Prolog operator\\u2019s binding tightness measure is, the more it takes precedence for parsing. These binding tightness measures range inclusively from 1 (maximum precedence) to 1200 (minimum precedence).\\n\\nThe third argument of `op/3` can be any syntactically well-formed Prolog functor. In particular, these need not be known as operator prior to runtime. Prolog\\u2019s tokenizer only recognizes such a token as a functor. Thus, any functor, whether declared operator or not, can always be parsed as a prefix operator preceding a parenthesized comma-separated sequence of arguments. Whether it is a declared operator determines how it may be parsed otherwise. In Sicstus Prolog, for example:\\n\\n```\\n| ?- X = 1 + 2.  \\n  X = 1+2 ? \\n  yes  \\n| ?- X = +(1,2).  \\n  X = 1+2 ? \\n  yes\\n```\\n\\nProlog\\u2019s parser can accommodate dynamic operators for two reasons:\\n\\n\\\\(^{28}\\\\) Note that \\u2018yfy\\u2019 is not allowed as an operator specifier because that would mean an ambiguous way of parsing the operator by associating either to the left or to the right.\\n1. The syntax of Prolog is completely uniform - there is only one syntactic construct: the first-order term. Even what appear to be punctuation symbols are in fact functors (e.g., \\u2018:-\\u2019, \\u2018,\\u2019 \\u2018;\\u2019, etc., \\u2026). Indeed, in Prolog everything is either a logical variable or a structure of the form \\\\( f(t_1, \\\\ldots, t_n) \\\\).\\n\\n2. Prolog parser\\u2019s is an operator-precedence parser where precedence and associativity information is kept as a dynamic structure.29\\n\\nOperator-precedence parsing is a bottom-up shift-reduce method that works simply by shifting over the input looking for a handle in a sentential form being built on the stack, and reducing when such a handle is recognized. A handle is the substring of a sentential form whose right end is the leftmost operator whose following operator has smaller precedence, and whose left end is the rightmost operator to the left of this right-end operator (inclusive), whose preceding operator has smaller precedence. This substring includes any nonterminals on either ends. For example, if \\u2018*\\u2019 has higher precedence than \\u2018+\\u2019, the handle in \\u2018E + E * E + E\\u2019 is \\u2018E * E\\u2019.\\n\\nOperator-precedence parsing is possible only for a very restricted class of grammars - the so-called \\u201cOperator Grammars.\\u201d A context-free grammar is an Operator Grammar if and only if no production\\u2019s right-hand side is empty or contains two adjacent non-terminals. For example, the grammar:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nE : \\\\text{'id'} \\\\mid P \\\\ E \\\\mid E \\\\ O \\\\ E \\\\mid (E \\\\ E) ; \\\\\\\\\\nP : \\\\text{'}-\\\\text{'} ; \\\\\\\\\\nO : \\\\text{'+'} \\\\mid \\\\text{'*'} \\\\mid \\\\text{'-'} \\\\mid \\\\text{'/'} ;\\n\\\\]\\n\\nis not an operator grammar. But the equivalent grammar:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nE : \\\\text{'id'} \\\\mid \\\\text{'-'} E \\\\mid E \\\\ ' + ' E \\\\mid E \\\\ ' * ' E \\\\mid E \\\\ ' - ' E \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mid E \\\\ ' / ' E \\\\mid (E \\\\ E) ;\\n\\\\]\\n\\nis. It is not difficult to see that a Prolog term can easily be recognized by an operator grammar. Namely,\\n\\n\\\\[\\nT : \\\\text{'var'} \\\\mid \\\\text{'fun'} \\\\mid \\\\text{'fun'} \\\\ ' (B) \\\\text{'} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mid \\\\text{'fun'} \\\\ T \\\\mid T \\\\ 'fun' \\\\ T \\\\mid T \\\\ 'fun' \\\\ T \\\\mid (T \\\\ T) ; \\\\\\\\\\nB : T \\\\mid T , B ;\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhich can thus easily accommodate dynamic operators.\\n\\n## B Structure of Kernel Expressions\\n\\nThe class \\\\( \\\\text{kernel}.Expression.\\\\text{java} \\\\) is the mother of all expressions in the kernel language. It specifies the prototypes of the methods that must be implemented by all expression subclasses. The subclasses of \\\\text{Expression} are:\\n\\n- \\\\textbf{Constant}: constant (void, boolean, integer, real number, object);\\n- \\\\textbf{Abstraction}: functional abstraction (\\\\textit{\\u00e0 la} \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)-calculus);\\n\\n---\\n\\n29 See \\u201cthe Dragon Book,\\u201d [2]\\u2014Section 4.6, pp. 203\\u2013215.\\n- **Application**: functional application;\\n- **Local**: local name;\\n- **Parameter**: a function\\u2019s formal parameter (really a pseudo-expression as it is not fully processed as a real expression and is used as a shared type information repository for all occurrences in a function\\u2019s body of the variable it stands for);\\n- **Global**: global name;\\n- **Dummy**: temporary place holder in lieu of a name prior to being discriminated into a local or global one.\\n- **Definition**: definition of a global name with an expression defining it in a global store;\\n- **IfThenElse**: conditional;\\n- **AndOr**: non-strict Boolean conjunction and disjunction;\\n- **Sequence**: sequence of expressions (presumably with side-effects);\\n- **Let**: lexical scoping construct;\\n- **Loop**: conditional iteration construct;\\n- **ExitWithValue**: non-local function exit;\\n- **Assignment**: construct to set the value of a local or a global variable;\\n- **NewArray**: construct to create a new (multidimensional) array;\\n- **ArraySlot**: construct to access the element of an array;\\n- **ArraySlotUpdate**: construct to update the element of an array;\\n- **Tuple**: construct to create a new position-indexed tuple;\\n- **NamedTuple**: construct to create a new name-indexed tuple;\\n- **TupleProjection**: construct to access the component of a tuple;\\n- **TupleUpdate**: construct to update the component of a tuple;\\n- **NewObject**: construct to create a new object;\\n- **DottedNotation**: construct to emulate traditional object-oriented \\u201cdot\\u201d dereferencing notation;\\n- **FieldUpdate**: construct to update the value of an object\\u2019s field;\\n- **ArrayExtension**: construct denoting a literal array;\\n- **ArrayInitializer**: construct denoting a syntactic convenience for specifying initialization of an array from an extension;\\n- **Homomorphism**: construct denoting a monoid homomorphism;\\n- **Comprehension**: construct denoting a monoid comprehension;\\n\\nTo illustrate the process, we next describe a few kernel constructs. A kernel expression description usually consist of some of the following items:\\n\\n- **Abstract Syntax**\\u2014describes the abstract syntax form of the kernel expression.\\n- **Operational Semantics**\\u2014for unfamiliar expressions, this describes informally the meaning of the expression. The notation $[e]$, where $e$ is an abstract syntax expression, denotes the (mathematical) semantic *denotation* of $e$. The notation $[T]$, where $T$ is a type, denotes the (mathematical) semantic *denotation* of $T$\\u2014namely, $[T]$ is the set of all abstract denotations $[e]$\\u2019s such that kernel expression $e$ has type $T$. \\nTYPING RULE\\u2014this describes more formally how a type should be verified or inferred using formal rules \\u00e0 la Plotkin\\u2019s Structural Operational Semantics for typing the kernel expression, whose notation is briefly recalled as follows [35,36].\\n\\nA typing judgment is a formula of the form $\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash e : T$, and is read as: \\u201cunder typing context $\\\\Gamma$, expression $e$ has type $T$.\\u201d\\n\\nIn its simplest form, a typing context $\\\\Gamma$ is a function mapping the parameters of $\\\\lambda$-abstractions to their types. In the formal presentation of an expression\\u2019s typing rule, the context keeps the type binding under which the typing derivation has progressed up to applying the rule in which it occurs.\\n\\nThe notation $\\\\Gamma[x:T]$ denotes the context defined from $\\\\Gamma$ as follows:\\n\\n$$\\\\Gamma[x:T](y) \\\\overset{\\\\Delta}{=} \\\\begin{cases} T & \\\\text{if } y = x; \\\\\\\\ \\\\Gamma(y) & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases}$$ (13)\\n\\nA typing rule is a formula of the form:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{J_1, \\\\ldots, J_n}{J}$$ (14)\\n\\nwhere $J$ and the $J_i$\\u2019s, $i = 0, \\\\ldots, n, \\\\ n \\\\geq 0$, are typing judgments. This \\u201cfraction\\u201d notation expresses essentially an implication: when all the formulae of the rule\\u2019s premises (the $J_i$\\u2019s in the fraction\\u2019s \\u201cnumerator\\u201d) hold, then the formula in the rule\\u2019s conclusion (the fraction\\u2019s \\u201cdenominator\\u201d) holds too. When $n = 0$, the rule has no premise\\u2014i.e., the premise is tautologically true (e.g., $0 = 0$)\\u2014the rule is called an axiom and is written with an empty \\u201cnumerator.\\u201d\\n\\nA conditional typing rule is a typing rule of the form:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{J_1, \\\\ldots, J_n}{J \\\\quad \\\\text{if} \\\\quad c(J_1, \\\\ldots, J_n)}$$ (15)\\n\\nwhere $c$ is a Boolean metacondition involving the rule\\u2019s judgments.\\n\\nA typing rule (or axiom), whether or not in conditional form, is usually read backwards (i.e., upwards) from the rule\\u2019s conclusion (the bottom part, or \\u201cdenominator\\u201d) to the rule\\u2019s premises (the top part, or \\u201cnumerator\\u201d). Namely, the rule of the form:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_1 \\\\vdash e_1 : T_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\Gamma_n \\\\vdash e_n : T_n}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash e : T}$$ (16)\\n\\nis read thus:\\n\\n\\u201cThe expression $e$ has type $T$ under typing context $\\\\Gamma$ if the expression $e_1$ has type $T_1$ under typing context $\\\\Gamma_1$, and . . . , the expression $e_n$ has type $T_n$ under typing context $\\\\Gamma_n$.\\u201d\\nFor example:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash c : \\\\text{Boolean}, \\\\quad \\\\Gamma \\\\vdash e_1 : T, \\\\quad \\\\Gamma \\\\vdash e_2 : T\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash \\\\text{if } c \\\\text{ then } e_1 \\\\text{ else } e_2 : T\\n\\\\]\\n\\nis read thus:\\n\\n\\u201cThe expression if \\\\( c \\\\) then \\\\( e_1 \\\\) else \\\\( e_2 \\\\) has type \\\\( T \\\\) under typing context \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) if the expression \\\\( c \\\\) has type \\\\( \\\\text{Boolean} \\\\) under typing context \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) and if both expressions \\\\( e_1 \\\\) and \\\\( e_2 \\\\) have the same type \\\\( T \\\\) under the same typing context \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\).\\u201d\\n\\nWith judgments spelled-out, a conditional typing rule (15) looks like:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{ll}\\n\\\\Gamma_1 \\\\vdash e_1 : T_1, & \\\\ldots, \\\\Gamma_n \\\\vdash e_n : T_n \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash e : T\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nif \\\\( \\\\text{cond}(\\\\Gamma, \\\\Gamma_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\Gamma_n, e, e_1, \\\\ldots, e_n, T, T_1, \\\\ldots, T_n) \\\\) (17)\\n\\nwhere \\u201c\\\\( \\\\text{cond}(\\\\Gamma, \\\\Gamma_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\Gamma_n, \\\\ldots, e, e_1, \\\\ldots, e_n, T, T_1, \\\\ldots, T_n) \\\\)\\u201d is a Boolean meta-condition involving the contexts, expressions, and types. Such a rule is read thus:\\n\\n\\u201cif the meta-condition holds, then the expression \\\\( e \\\\) has type \\\\( T \\\\) under typing context \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) if the expression \\\\( e_1 \\\\) has type \\\\( T_1 \\\\) under typing context \\\\( \\\\Gamma_1 \\\\), and \\\\ldots , the expression \\\\( e_n \\\\) has type \\\\( T_n \\\\) under typing context \\\\( \\\\Gamma_n \\\\).\\u201d\\n\\nAn example of a conditional rule is that of abstractions that must take into account whether or not the abstraction is exitable\\u2014i.e., it may be exited non-locally:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{ll}\\n\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash x_1 : T_1, \\\\ldots, x_n : T_n \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash \\\\text{fun } x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n \\\\cdot e : T_1, \\\\ldots, T_n \\\\rightarrow T\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nif \\\\( \\\\text{fun } x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n \\\\cdot e \\\\) is not exitable.\\n\\nSimilarly, a typing axiom:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash e : T\\n\\\\] (18)\\n\\nis read as: \\u201cThe expression \\\\( e \\\\) has type \\\\( T \\\\) under typing context \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\)\\u201d and a conditional typing axiom is a typing axiom of the form:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash e : T \\\\quad \\\\text{if } c(\\\\Gamma, e, T)\\n\\\\] (19)\\n\\nwhere \\\\( c(\\\\Gamma, e, T) \\\\) is a Boolean meta-condition on typing context \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\), expression \\\\( e \\\\), and type \\\\( T \\\\) and is read as, \\u201cif the meta-condition \\\\( c(\\\\Gamma, e, T) \\\\) holds then the expression \\\\( e \\\\) has type \\\\( T \\\\) under typing context \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\).\\u201d\\n\\n- **Compiling Rule**\\u2014describes the way the expression\\u2019s components are mapped into a straightline sequence of instructions.

Objects of class Constant denote literal constants: the integers (e.g., \\\\(-1, 0, 1, \\\\text{etc.}\\\\) ), the real numbers (e.g., \\\\(-1.23, \\\\ldots, 0.0, \\\\ldots, 1.23, \\\\text{etc.}\\\\) ), the characters (e.g., \\\\(\\\\text{\\u2019a\\u2019, \\u2019b\\u2019, \\u2019\\\\@\\u2019, \\u2019#\\u2019, etc.}\\\\) ), and the constants void, true, and false. The constant void is of type Void, such that:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{[Void]} \\\\; \\\\overset{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\; \\\\{\\\\text{[void]}\\\\}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand the constants:\\n\\ntrue and false of type Boolean, such that:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{[Boolean]} \\\\; \\\\overset{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\; \\\\{\\\\text{[false]}, \\\\text{[true]}\\\\}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nOther built-in types are:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{[Int]} \\\\; \\\\overset{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\; \\\\mathbb{Z} = \\\\{\\\\ldots, [-1], [0], [1], \\\\ldots\\\\}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{[Real]} \\\\; \\\\overset{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\; \\\\mathbb{R} = \\\\{\\\\ldots, [-1.23], \\\\ldots, [0.0], \\\\ldots, [1.23], \\\\ldots\\\\}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{[Char]} \\\\; \\\\overset{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\; \\\\text{set of all Unicode characters}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{[String]} \\\\; \\\\overset{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\; \\\\text{set of all finite strings of Unicode characters.}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the Constant expression class is further subclassed into: Int, Real, Char, NewObject, and BuiltinObjectConstant, whose instances denote, respectively: integers, floating-point numbers, characters, new objects, and built-in object constants (e.g., strings).\\n\\n\\u2013 Typing Rule The typing rules for each kind of constant are:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash \\\\text{void} : \\\\text{Void}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash \\\\text{true} : \\\\text{Boolean}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash \\\\text{false} : \\\\text{Boolean}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash n : \\\\text{Int} \\\\quad \\\\text{if } n \\\\text{ is an integer}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash n : \\\\text{Real} \\\\quad \\\\text{if } n \\\\text{ is a floating-point number}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash c : \\\\text{Char} \\\\quad \\\\text{if } c \\\\text{ is a character}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash s : \\\\text{String} \\\\quad \\\\text{if } s \\\\text{ is a string}}\\n\\\\]\\n- **Compiling Rule** Compiling a constant consists in pushing the value it denotes on the stack of corresponding sort.\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n\\\\text{[void]} \\\\ & \\\\ \\\\text{compile}[\\text{void}] = \\\\text{NOP} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{[true]} \\\\ & \\\\ \\\\text{compile}[\\text{true}] = \\\\text{PUSH}_\\\\text{TRUE} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{[false]} \\\\ & \\\\ \\\\text{compile}[\\text{false}] = \\\\text{PUSH}_\\\\text{FALSE} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{[int]} \\\\ & \\\\ \\\\text{compile}[n] = \\\\text{PUSH}_I n \\\\quad \\\\text{if } n \\\\text{ is an integer} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{[real]} \\\\ & \\\\ \\\\text{compile}[n] = \\\\text{PUSH}_R n \\\\quad \\\\text{if } n \\\\text{ is a floating-point number} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{[char]} \\\\ & \\\\ \\\\text{compile}[c] = \\\\text{PUSH}_I c \\\\quad \\\\text{if } c \\\\text{ is a character} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{[string]} \\\\ & \\\\ \\\\text{compile}[s] = \\\\text{PUSH}_O s \\\\quad \\\\text{if } s \\\\text{ is a string}\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n**The Abstraction expression**\\n\\n- **Abstract Syntax** This is the standard \\u03bb-calculus functional abstraction, possibly with multiple parameters. Rather than using the conventional \\u03bb notation, we write an abstraction as:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{fun } x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n \\\\cdot e\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere the \\\\( x_i \\\\)'s are *abstraction parameters*\\u2014identifiers denoting variables local to the expression \\\\( e \\\\), the abstraction\\u2019s *body*.\\n\\n- **Typing Rule** There are two cases to consider depending on whether the abstraction is or not *exitable*. An exitable abstraction is one that corresponds to a real source language\\u2019s function from which a user may exit non-locally. Other (non-exitable) abstractions are those that are implicitly generated by syntactic desugaring of surface syntax. It is the responsibility of the parser to identify the two kinds of abstractions and mark as exitable all and only those abstractions that should be.\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma \\\\vDash [x_1 : T_1] \\\\cdots [x_n : T_n] \\\\vdash e : T}{\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash \\\\text{fun } x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n \\\\cdot e : T_1, \\\\ldots, T_n \\\\to T} \\\\quad \\\\text{if } \\\\text{fun } x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n \\\\cdot e \\\\text{ is not exitable} \\\\tag{24}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nIf the abstraction is exitable however, we must record it in the typing context.

This operation is captured by the simple operational semantics of each of the three \\\\text{RETURN} \\\\ instructions. Namely, when executing a \\\\text{RETURN} instruction, the runtime performs the following three-step procedure:\\n\\n  1. it pops the result from its result stack;\\\\(^30\\\\)\\n  2. it restores the latest saved runtime state (popped off the saved-state stack);\\n  3. it pushes the result popped in Step 1 onto the restored state\\u2019s own result stack.\\n\\n  Then, control follows up with the next instruction.\\n\\n  However, it is also often desirable, under certain circumstances, that computation \\\\textit{not} be let to proceed further at its current level of nesting of \\\\textit{exitable} abstractions. Then, computation may be allowed to return right away from this current nesting (\\\\textit{i.e.}, as if having fallen off this level of exitable abstraction) when the conditions for this to happen are met. Exiting an abstraction thus must also return a specific value that may be a function of the context. This is what the kernel construction \\\\text{exit with } v \\\\ expresses. This kernel construction is provided in order to specify that the current local computation should terminate without further ado, and exit with the value denoted by the specified expression.\\n\\n\\\\(^30\\\\) Where stack here means \\u201cstack of \\\\textit{appropriate} runtime sort;\\u201d appropriate, that is, as per the instruction\\u2019s runtime sort\\u2014\\\\textit{viz.}, ending in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{I}\\\\) for \\\\text{INT}, \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\) for \\\\text{REAL}, or \\\\(\\\\mathbb{O}\\\\) for \\\\text{OBJECT}.\\\\)\\nNow, there are several notions in the above paragraphs that need some clarification. For example, what an \\u201cexitable\\u201d abstraction is, and why worry about a dedicated construct in the kernel language for such a notion if it does nothing more than what is done by a \\\\texttt{RETURN} instruction.\\n\\nFirst of all, from its very name \\\\texttt{exit with} assumes that computation has entered that from which it must exit. This is an exitable abstraction; that is, the latest $\\\\lambda$-abstraction having the property of being exitable. Not all abstractions are exitable. For example, any abstraction that is generated as part of the target of some other kernel expression\\u2019s syntacting sugar (e.g., \\\\texttt{let $x_1 = e_1; \\\\ldots ; x_n = e_n; \\\\; in \\\\; e$} or \\\\texttt{$\\\\langle \\\\oplus, \\\\Pi \\\\rangle \\\\{ e \\\\mid x_1 \\\\leftarrow e_1, \\\\ldots , x_n \\\\leftarrow e_n \\\\}$}, and generally any construct that hide implicit abstractions within), will not be deemed exitable.\\n\\nSecondly, exiting with a value $v$ means that the type $T$ of $v$ must be congruent with what the return type of the abstraction being exited is. In other words:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Gamma \\\\vdash N_{T'} : T' \\\\rightarrow T, \\\\quad \\\\Gamma \\\\vdash v : T\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $N_{T'}$ denotes the latest exitable abstraction in the context $\\\\Gamma$.\\n\\nThe above scheme indicates the following necessities:\\n\\n1. The typing rules for an abstraction deemed exitable must record in its typing context $\\\\Gamma$ the latest exitable abstraction, if any such exists; (if none does, a static semantics error is triggered to indicate that it is impossible to exit from anywhere before first entering somewhere).\\n\\n2. Congruently, the \\\\texttt{APPLY} instruction of an exitable closure must take care of chaining this exitable closure before it pushes a new state for it in the saved state stack of the runtime system with the last saved exitable closure, and mark the saved state as being exitable; dually, this exitable state stack must also be popped upon \\u201cfalling off\\u201d\\u2014i.e., normally exiting\\u2014an exitable closure. That is, whenever an exitable state is restored.\\n\\n3. New non-local return instructions \\\\texttt{NLRETURN} (for each runtime sort) must be defined like their corresponding \\\\texttt{RETURN} instructions except that the runtime state to restore is the one popped out of the exitable state stack.\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n\\\\text{Compiling Rule} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{compile}[^{\\\\text{exit with}} v] &= \\\\text{compile}[^{\\\\text{v}}] \\\\sp{\\\\text{NLRETURN sort}}(v) \\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\n\\\\textbf{C Monoids}\\n\\nIn this section, all notions and notations relating to monoids as they are used in this paper are recalled and justified.\\n\\nMathematically, a monoid is a non-empty set equipped with an associative internal binary operation and an identity element for this operation. Formally, let $S$ be a set, $\\\\ast$ a function from $S \\\\times S$ to $S$, and $\\\\epsilon \\\\in S$; then, \\\\langle $S$, $\\\\ast$, $\\\\epsilon$ \\\\rangle is a monoid iff, for any $x, y, z$ in $S$:\\n\\n$$\\nx \\\\ast (y \\\\ast z) = (x \\\\ast y) \\\\ast z$$\\n\\nThis is why Typing Rule (25) needs to treat both kinds of abstractions.\\nand\\n\\n\\\\[ x \\\\star \\\\epsilon = \\\\epsilon \\\\star x = \\\\epsilon. \\\\quad (44) \\\\]\\n\\nMost familiar mathematical binary operations define monoids. For example, taking the set of natural numbers \\\\( \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\), and the set of boolean values \\\\( \\\\mathbb{B} = \\\\{ \\\\text{true}, \\\\text{false} \\\\} \\\\), the following are monoids:\\n\\n- \\\\( \\\\langle \\\\mathbb{N}, +, 0 \\\\rangle \\\\),\\n- \\\\( \\\\langle \\\\mathbb{N}, \\\\times, 1 \\\\rangle \\\\),\\n- \\\\( \\\\langle \\\\mathbb{N}, \\\\max, 0 \\\\rangle \\\\),\\n- \\\\( \\\\langle \\\\mathbb{B}, \\\\lor, \\\\text{false} \\\\rangle \\\\),\\n- \\\\( \\\\langle \\\\mathbb{B}, \\\\land, \\\\text{true} \\\\rangle \\\\).\\n\\nThe operations of these monoids are so familiar that they need not be explicated. For us, they have a \\u201cbuilt-in\\u201d semantics that allows us to compute with them since primary school. Indeed, we shall refer to such readily interpreted monoids as **primitive monoids**.\\n\\nNote that the definition of a monoid does not preclude additional algebraic structure. Such structure may be specified by other equations augmenting the basic monoid equational theory given by the conjunction of equations (43) and (44). For example, all five monoids listed above are **commutative**; namely, they also obey equation (45):\\n\\n\\\\[ x \\\\star y = y \\\\star x \\\\quad (45) \\\\]\\n\\nfor any \\\\( x, y \\\\). In addition, the three last ones (i.e., \\\\( \\\\max \\\\), \\\\( \\\\lor \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\land \\\\)) are also **idempotent**; namely, they also obey equation (46):\\n\\n\\\\[ x \\\\star x = x \\\\quad (46) \\\\]\\n\\nfor any \\\\( x \\\\).\\n\\nNot all monoids are primitive monoids. That is, one may define a monoid purely syntactically whose operation only builds a syntactic structure rather than being interpreted using some semantic computation. For example, linear lists have such a structure: the operation is list concatenation and builds a list out of two lists; its identity element is the empty list. A syntactic monoid may also have additional algebraic structure. For example, the monoid of bags is also defined as a commutative syntactic monoid with the disjunct union operation and the empty bag as identity. Or, the monoid of sets is a commutative and idempotent syntactic monoid with the union operation and the empty set as identity.\\n\\nBecause it is not interpreted, a syntactic monoid poses a problem as far as the representation of its elements is concerned. To illustrate this, let us consider an empty-theory algebraic structure; that is, one without any equations\\u2014not even associativity nor identity. Let us take such a structure with one binary operation \\\\( \\\\star \\\\) on, say, the natural numbers\\n\\n---\\n\\n32 We call these monoids \\u201cprimitive\\u201d following the presentation of Fegaras and Maier [22] as it adheres to a more operational (as opposed to mathematical) approach more suitable to computer-scientists. Mathematically, however, these should be called \\u201csemantic\\u201d monoids since they are interpreted by the computation semantics of their operations. See Appendix Section E.1 for an overview of this formalism.\\nN. Saying that \\\\( \\\\ast \\\\) is a \\u201csyntactic\\u201d operation means that it constructs a syntactic term (i.e., an expression tree) by composing two other syntactic terms. We thus can define the set \\\\( T_\\\\ast \\\\) of \\\\( \\\\ast \\\\)-terms on some base set, say the natural numbers, inductively as the limit \\\\( \\\\bigcup_{n \\\\geq 0} T_n \\\\) where,\\n\\n\\\\[\\nT_n \\\\overset{\\\\text{def}}{=} \\\\begin{cases} \\n\\\\mathbb{N} & \\\\text{if } n = 0 \\\\\\\\\\nT_{n-1} \\\\cup \\\\{ t_1 \\\\ast t_2 \\\\mid t_i \\\\in T_{n-1}, i = 1, 2 \\\\} & \\\\text{if } n > 0.\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n(47)\\n\\nClearly, the set \\\\( T_\\\\ast \\\\) is well defined and so is the \\\\( \\\\ast \\\\) operation over it. Indeed, \\\\( \\\\ast \\\\) is a bona fide function from \\\\( T_\\\\ast \\\\times T_\\\\ast \\\\) to \\\\( T_\\\\ast \\\\) mapping two terms \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and \\\\( t_2 \\\\) in \\\\( T_\\\\ast \\\\) into a unique term in \\\\( T_\\\\ast \\\\)\\u2014namely, \\\\( t_1 \\\\ast t_2 \\\\). This is why \\\\( T_\\\\ast \\\\) is called the syntactic algebra.\\n\\nLet us now assume that the \\\\( \\\\ast \\\\) operation is associative\\u2014i.e., that \\\\( \\\\ast \\\\)-terms verify Equation (43). Note that this equation defines a (syntactic) congruence on \\\\( T_\\\\ast \\\\) which identifies terms such as, say, \\\\( 1 \\\\ast (2 \\\\ast 3) \\\\) and \\\\( (1 \\\\ast 2) \\\\ast 3 \\\\). In fact, for such an associative \\\\( \\\\ast \\\\) operation, the set \\\\( T_\\\\ast \\\\) defined in Equation (47) is not the appropriate domain. Rather, the right domain is the quotient set whose elements are (syntactic) congruence classes modulo associativity of \\\\( \\\\ast \\\\). Therefore, this creates an ambiguity of representation of the syntactic structures.\\n\\nSimilarly, more algebraic structure defined by larger equational theories induces coarser quotients of the empty-theory algebra by putting together in common congruence classes all the syntactic expressions that can be identified modulo the theory\\u2019s equations. The more equations, the more ambiguous the syntactic structures of expressions. Mathematically, this poses no problem as one can always abstract away from individuals to congruence classes. However, operationally one must resort to some concrete artifact to obtain a unique representation for all members of the same congruence class. One way is to devise a canonical representation into which to transform all terms. For example, an associative operation could systematically \\u201cmove\\u201d nested subtrees from its left argument to its right argument\\u2014in effect using Equation (43) as a one-way rewrite rule. However, while this is possible for some equational theories, it is not so in general\\u2014e.g., take commutativity.\\\\(^{35}\\\\)\\n\\nFrom a programming standpoint (which is ours), we can abstract away from the ambiguity of canonical representations of syntactic monoid terms using a flat notation. For example, in LISP and Prolog, a list is seen as the (flat) sequence of its constituents.\\n\\n\\\\(^{33}\\\\) For a fixed set of base elements and operations (which constitute what is formally called a signature), the syntactic algebra is unique (up to isomorphism). This algebra is also called the free, or the initial, algebra for its signature.\\n\\n\\\\(^{34}\\\\) Note that this ambiguity never arises for semantic algebras whose operations are interpreted into a unique result.\\n\\n\\\\(^{35}\\\\) Such are important considerations in the field of term rewriting [20], where the problem of finding canonical term representations for equational theories was originally addressed by Donald Knuth and Peter Bendix in a seminal paper proposing a general effective method\\u2014the so-called Knuth-Bendix Completion Algorithm [29]. The problem, incidentally, is only semi-decidable. In other words, the Knuth-Bendix algorithm may diverge, although several interesting variations have been proposed for a wide extent of practical uses (see [20] for a good introduction and bibliography).\\nTypically, a programmer writes \\\\([1, 2, 1]\\\\) to represent the list whose elements are 1, 2, and 1 in this order, and does not care (nor need s/he be aware) of its concrete representation. A set\\u2014i.e., a commutative idempotent syntactic monoid\\u2014is usually denoted by the usual mathematical notation \\\\(\\\\{1, 2\\\\}\\\\), implicitly relying on disallowing duplicate elements, not minding the order in which the elements appear. A bag, or multiset\\u2014i.e., a commutative but non-idempotent syntactic monoid\\u2014uses a similar notation, allowing duplicate elements but paying no heed to the order in which they appear; i.e., \\\\(\\\\{\\\\{1, 2, 1\\\\}\\\\}\\\\) is the bag containing 1 twice, and 2 once.\\n\\nSyntactic monoids are quite useful for programming as they provide adequate data structures to represent collections of objects of a given type. Thus, we refer to them as collection monoids. Now, a definition such as Equation (47) for a syntactic monoid, although sound mathematically, is not quite adequate for programming purposes. This is because it defines the \\\\(*\\\\) operations on two distinct types of elements; namely, the base elements (here natural numbers) and constructed elements. In programming, it is desirable that operations be given a crisp type. A way to achieve this is by systematically \\u201cwrapping\\u201d each base element \\\\(x\\\\) into a term such as \\\\(x \\\\star \\\\varepsilon\\\\). This \\u201cwrapping\\u201d is achieve by associating to the monoid a function \\\\(U\\\\), from the base set into the monoid domain called its unit injection. For example, if ++ is the list monoid operation for concatenating two lists, \\\\(U_+ (x) = [x]\\\\) and one may view the list \\\\([a, b, c]\\\\) as \\\\([a]++[b]++[c]\\\\). Similarly, the set \\\\{a, b, c\\\\} is viewed as \\\\{a\\\\} \\\\sqcup \\\\{b\\\\} \\\\sqcup \\\\{c\\\\}, and the bag \\\\(\\\\{a, b, c\\\\}\\\\) as \\\\(\\\\{a\\\\} \\\\sqcup \\\\{b\\\\} \\\\sqcup \\\\{c\\\\}\\\\). Clearly, this bases the constructions on an isomorphic view of the base set rather than the base set itself, while using a uniform type for the monoid operator. Also, because the type of the base elements is irrelevant for the construction other than imposing the constraint that all such elements be of the same type, we present a collection monoid as a polymorphic data type. This justifies the formal view of monoids we give next using the programming notion of polymorphic type.\\n\\nBecause it is characterized by its operation \\\\(\\\\oplus\\\\), a monoid is often simply referred to as \\\\(\\\\oplus\\\\). Thus, a monoid operation is used as a subscript to denote its characteristic attributes. Namely, for a monoid \\\\(\\\\oplus\\\\),\\n\\n- \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\oplus}\\\\) is its type (i.e., \\\\(\\\\oplus : \\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\oplus} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\oplus} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\oplus}\\\\)),\\n- \\\\(\\\\mathbb{I}_{\\\\oplus}: \\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\oplus}\\\\) is its identity element,\\n- \\\\(\\\\Theta_{\\\\oplus}\\\\) is its equational theory (i.e., a subset of the set \\\\(\\\\{C, I\\\\}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) stands for \\u201ccommutative\\u201d and \\\\(I\\\\) for \\u201cidempotent\\u201d);\\n\\nand, if it is a collection monoid,\\n\\n- \\\\(\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\oplus}\\\\) is its type constructor (i.e., \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\oplus} = \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\oplus}(\\\\alpha)\\\\)),\\n- \\\\(\\\\mathcal{U}_{\\\\oplus}: \\\\alpha \\\\to \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\oplus}(\\\\alpha)\\\\) is its unit injection for any type variable \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\).\\n\\nExamples of familiar monoids of both kinds are given in Table 2 in terms of the above characteristic attributes.\\\\(^{36}\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\(^{36}\\\\) If the theory is \\\\(\\\\{I\\\\}\\\\)\\u2014i.e., idempotent but not commutative\\u2014this defines yet another, though unfamiliar, type of collection monoid where there may be redundant elements but only if not adjacent.\\nSome primitive monoids | Familiar Collection monoids\\n\\n| \\u2295 | T | \\u0398 | \\u2295 | T | \\u0398 |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| + | Int | 0 | {C} | \\u222a | set(\\u03b1) | {} | {x} | {C, I} |\\n| * | Int | 1 | {C} | \\u2287 | bag(\\u03b1) | [] | [x] | {C} |\\n| max | Int | 0 | {C, I} | | | | | |\\n| \\u2228 | Boolean | false | {C, I} | | | | | |\\n| \\u2227 | Boolean | true | {C, I} | | | | | |\\n\\nTable 2. Attributes of a few common monoids\\n\\nD The Typed Polymorphic \\u03bb-Calculus\\n\\nWe assume a set \\\\( C \\\\) of pregiven constants usually denoted by \\\\( a, b, \\\\ldots \\\\), and a countably infinite set of variable symbols \\\\( V \\\\) usually denoted by \\\\( x, y, \\\\ldots \\\\). The syntax of a term expression \\\\( e \\\\) of the \\u03bb-Calculus is given by the grammar shown in Fig. 5. We shall call\\n\\n\\\\[\\ne ::= a \\\\quad (a \\\\in C) \\\\text{ constant} \\\\\\\\\\n| x \\\\quad (x \\\\in V) \\\\text{ variable} \\\\\\\\\\n| \\\\lambda x. e \\\\quad (x \\\\in V) \\\\text{ abstraction} \\\\\\\\\\n| e e \\\\quad \\\\text{application}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nFig. 5. Basic \\u03bb-Calculus Expressions\\n\\n\\\\( \\\\Sigma \\\\) the set of term expressions \\\\( e \\\\) defined by this grammar. These terms are also called raw term expressions.\\n\\nAn abstraction \\\\( \\\\lambda x. e \\\\) defines a lexical scope for its bound variable \\\\( x \\\\), whose extent is its body \\\\( e \\\\). Thus, the notion of free occurrence of a variable in a term is defined as usual, and so is the operation \\\\( e_1[x \\\\leftarrow e_2] \\\\) of substituting a term \\\\( e_2 \\\\) for all the free occurrences of a variable \\\\( x \\\\) in a term \\\\( e_1 \\\\). Thus, a bound variable may be renamed to a new one in its scope without changing the abstraction.\\n\\nThe computation rule defined on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)-terms is the so-called \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)-reduction:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(\\\\lambda x. e_1) \\\\ e_2 \\\\rightarrow e_1[x \\\\leftarrow e_2].\\n\\\\] (48)\\n\\nWe assume a set \\\\( B \\\\) of basic type symbols denoted by \\\\( A, B, \\\\ldots \\\\), and a countably infinite set of type variables \\\\( TV \\\\) denoted by \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\ldots \\\\). The syntax of a type \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\) of the Typed Polymorphic \\u03bb-Calculus is given by the following grammar:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\tau ::= A \\\\quad (A \\\\in B) \\\\text{ basic type} \\\\\\\\\\n| \\\\alpha \\\\quad (\\\\alpha \\\\in TV) \\\\text{ type variable} \\\\\\\\\\n| \\\\tau \\\\rightarrow \\\\tau \\\\quad \\\\text{function type}\\n\\\\] (49)\\nWe shall call $\\\\mathcal{T}$ the set of types $\\\\tau$ defined by this grammar. A monomorphic type is a type that contains no variable types. Any type containing at least one variable type is called a polymorphic type.\\n\\nThe typing rules for the Typed Polymorphic $\\\\lambda$-Calculus are given in Fig. 6. These rules can be readily translated into a Logic Programming language based on Horn-clauses such as Prolog, and used as an effective means to infer the types of expressions based on the Typed Polymorphic $\\\\lambda$-Calculus.\\n\\nThe basic syntax of the Typed Polymorphic $\\\\lambda$-Calculus may be extended with other operators and convenient data structures as long as typing rules for the new constructs are provided. Typically, one provides at least the set $\\\\mathbb{N}$ of integer constants and $\\\\mathbb{B} = \\\\{ \\\\text{true}, \\\\text{false} \\\\}$ of boolean constants, along with basic arithmetic and boolean operators, pairing (or tupling), a conditional operator, and a fix-point operator. The usual arithmetic and boolean operators are denoted by constant symbols (e.g., $+,-,*,$ etc.). Let $O$ be this set.\\n\\nThe computation rules for these operators are based on their usual semantics as one might expect, modulo transforming the usual binary infix notation to a \\u201ccurried\\u201d application. For example, $e_1 + e_2$ is implicitly taken to be the application $(+ e_1) e_2$. Note that this means that all such operators are implicitly \\u201ccurried.\\u201d\\n\\nFor example, we may augment the grammar for the terms given in Fig. 5 with the additional rules in Fig. 7.\\n\\n---\\n\\n37 Recall that a curried form of an $n$-ary function $f$ is obtained when $f$ is applied to less arguments than it expects; i.e., $f(e_1, \\\\ldots, e_k)$ for $1 \\\\leq k < n$. In the $\\\\lambda$-calculus, this form is simply interpreted as the abstraction $\\\\lambda x_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda x_{n-k}. f(e_1, \\\\ldots, e_k, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_{n-k})$. In their fully curried form, all $n$-ary functions can be seen as unary functions; indeed, with this interpretation of curried forms, it is clear that $f(e_1, \\\\ldots, e_n) = (\\\\ldots (f e_1) \\\\ldots e_{n-1}) e_n$. \\n\\n\\\\[ e ::= \\\\ldots \\\\quad \\\\text{\\\\textit{\\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\)-calculus expression}} \\\\\\\\\\n| \\\\langle e, \\\\cdots, e \\\\rangle \\\\quad \\\\text{tupling} \\\\\\\\\\n| e.n \\\\quad (n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}) \\\\quad \\\\text{projection} \\\\\\\\\\n| \\\\text{if } e \\\\text{ then } e \\\\text{ else } e \\\\quad \\\\text{conditional} \\\\\\\\\\n| \\\\text{fix } e \\\\quad \\\\text{fixpoint} \\\\]\\n\\n**Fig. 7.** Additional syntax for the extended \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\)-calculus (with Fig. 5)\\n\\nThe computation rules for the other new constructs are:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\langle e_1, \\\\cdots, e_k \\\\rangle.i \\\\rightarrow \\\\begin{cases} \\n  e_i & \\\\text{if } 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq k \\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\text{undefined} & \\\\text{otherwise}\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{if } e \\\\text{ then } e_1 \\\\text{ else } e_2 \\\\rightarrow \\\\begin{cases} \\n  e_1 & \\\\text{if } e = \\\\text{true} \\\\\\\\\\n  e_2 & \\\\text{if } e = \\\\text{false} \\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\text{undefined} & \\\\text{otherwise}\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\] \\\\hspace{1cm} (50)\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{fix } e \\\\rightarrow e \\\\ (\\\\text{fix } e)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nTo account for the new constructs, the syntax of types is extended accordingly to:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\tau ::= \\\\text{Int} | \\\\text{Boolean} \\\\quad \\\\text{basic type} \\\\\\\\\\n| \\\\alpha \\\\quad (\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathcal{T}) \\\\quad \\\\text{type variable} \\\\\\\\\\n| \\\\langle \\\\tau, \\\\cdots, \\\\tau \\\\rangle \\\\quad \\\\text{tuple type} \\\\\\\\\\n| \\\\tau \\\\rightarrow \\\\tau \\\\quad \\\\text{function type} \\\\] \\\\hspace{1cm} (51)\\n\\nWe are given that \\\\(\\\\text{type}(n) = \\\\text{Int}\\\\) for all \\\\(n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\) and that \\\\(\\\\text{type}(\\\\text{true}) = \\\\text{Boolean}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\text{type}(\\\\text{false}) = \\\\text{Boolean}\\\\). The (fully curried) types of the built-in operators are given similarly; namely, integer addition has type \\\\(\\\\text{type}(+) = \\\\text{Int} \\\\rightarrow (\\\\text{Int} \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{Int})\\\\), Boolean disjunction has type \\\\(\\\\text{type}(\\\\lor) = \\\\text{Boolean} \\\\rightarrow (\\\\text{Boolean} \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{Boolean})\\\\), etc., \\\\ldots\\n\\nThe additional typing rules for this extended calculus are given in Fig. 8.\\n\\n**E  Object Query Language Formalisms**\\n\\nIn this section, I review a formal syntax for processing collections due to Peter Buneman \\\\textit{et al.} [14,15] and elaborated by Leonidas Fegaras and David Maier [22] using the notion of \\\\textit{Monoid Comprehensions}.\\n\\n**E.1  Monoid homomorphisms and comprehensions**\\n\\nThe formalism presented here is based on [22] and assumes familiarity with the notions and notations summarized in Appendix Section C. I will use the programming view of monoids exposed there using the specific notation of monoid attributes, in particular for sets, bags, and lists. I will also assume basic familiarity with naive \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\)-calculus and associated typing as presented in Appendix Section D.\\nMonoid homomorphisms. Because many operations and data structures are monoids, it is interesting to use the associated concepts as the computational building block of an essential calculus. In particular, iteration over collection types can be elegantly formulated as computing a monoid homomorphism. This notion coincides with the usual mathematical notion of homomorphism, albeit given here from an operational standpoint and biased toward collection monoids. Basically, a monoid homomorphism \\\\( \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus \\\\) maps a function \\\\( f \\\\) from a collection monoid \\\\( \\\\oplus \\\\) to any monoid \\\\( \\\\odot \\\\) by collecting all the \\\\( f \\\\)-images of elements of a \\\\( \\\\oplus \\\\)-collection using the \\\\( \\\\odot \\\\) operation. For example, the expression \\\\( \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus \\\\cup \\\\cup \\\\lambda x. x + 1 \\\\) applied to the list \\\\([1, 2, 1, 3, 2]\\\\) returns the set \\\\(\\\\{2, 3, 4\\\\}\\\\).\\\\(^{38}\\\\)\\n\\nIn other words, the monoid homomorphism \\\\( \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus \\\\cup \\\\cup \\\\) of a function \\\\( f \\\\) applied to a list \\\\( L \\\\) corresponds to the following loop computation collecting the \\\\( f \\\\)-images of the list elements into a set (each \\\\( f \\\\)-image being a set):\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{result} \\\\leftarrow \\\\emptyset; \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{foreach } x \\\\text{ in } L \\\\text{ do result } \\\\leftarrow \\\\text{result} \\\\cup f(x); \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{return result;}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis is formalized as follows:\\n\\n**Definition 1 (Monoid Homomorphism).** A Monoid Homomorphism \\\\( \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus \\\\) defines a mapping from a collection homomorphism \\\\( \\\\oplus \\\\) to any monoid \\\\( \\\\odot \\\\) such that \\\\( \\\\Theta_\\\\oplus \\\\subseteq \\\\Theta_\\\\odot \\\\) by:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n\\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus(f)(\\\\emptyset) & \\\\triangleq \\\\emptyset \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus(f)(\\\\{x\\\\}) & \\\\triangleq f(x) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus(f)(x \\\\oplus y) & \\\\triangleq \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus(f)(x) \\\\odot \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus(f)(y)\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nfor any function \\\\( f : \\\\alpha \\\\rightarrow \\\\Sigma_\\\\oplus \\\\), \\\\( x : \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( y : \\\\alpha \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\Sigma_\\\\oplus = \\\\Sigma_\\\\oplus(\\\\alpha) \\\\).\\n\\nAgain, computationally, this amounts to executing the following iteration:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{result} \\\\leftarrow \\\\emptyset; \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{foreach } x_i \\\\text{ in } \\\\{\\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus(x_1) \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus(x_n)\\\\} \\\\text{ do result } \\\\leftarrow \\\\text{result} \\\\odot f(x_i); \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{return result;}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\(^{38}\\\\) See Table 2 for notation of a few common monoids.\\nThe reader may be puzzled by the condition $\\\\Theta_\\\\oplus \\\\subseteq \\\\Theta_\\\\otimes$ in Definition 1. It means that a monoid homomorphism may only be defined from a collection monoid to a monoid that has at least the same equational theory. In other words, one can only go from an empty theory monoid, to either a $\\\\{C\\\\}$-monoid or an $\\\\{I\\\\}$-monoid, or yet to a $\\\\{C,I\\\\}$-monoid. This requirement is due to an algebraic technicality, and relaxing it would cause a monoid homomorphism to be ill-defined. To see this, consider going from, say, a commutative-idempotent monoid to one that is commutative but not idempotent. Let us take, for example, $\\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus$. Then, this entails:\\n\\n$$1 = \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. 1](\\\\{a\\\\})$$\\n$$= \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. 1](\\\\{a\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\{a\\\\})$$\\n$$= \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. 1](\\\\{a\\\\}) + \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. 1](\\\\{a\\\\})$$\\n$$= 1 + 1$$\\n$$= 2.$$\\n\\nThe reader may have noticed that this restriction has the unfortunate consequence of disallowing potentially useful computations, notable examples being computing the cardinality of a set, or converting a set into a list. However, this drawback can be easily overcome with a suitable modification of the third clause in Definition 1, and other expressions based on it, ensuring that anomalous cases such as the above are dealt with by appropriate tests.\\n\\nIt is important to note that, for the consistency of Definition 1, a non-idempotent monoid must actually be anti-idempotent, and a non-commutative monoid must be anti-commutative. Indeed, if $\\\\oplus$ is non-idempotent as well as non-anti-idempotent (say, $x_0 \\\\oplus x_0 = x_0$ for some $x_0$), then this entails:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. f](x_0) = \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. f](x_0 \\\\oplus x_0)$$\\n$$= \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. f](x_0) \\\\odot \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. f](x_0)$$\\n\\nwhich is not necessarily true for non-idempotent $\\\\odot$. A similar argument may be given for commutativity. This consistency condition is in fact not restrictive operationally as it is always verified (e.g., a list will not allow partial commutation of any of its element).\\n\\nHere are a few familiar functions expressed with well-defined monoid homomorphisms:\\n\\n- $\\\\text{length}(l) = \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. 1](l)$\\n- $e \\\\in s = \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. x = e](s)$\\n- $s \\\\times t = \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda y. \\\\{ (x, y) \\\\}](t)](s)$\\n- $\\\\text{map}(f, s) = \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. \\\\{ f(x) \\\\}](s)$\\n- $\\\\text{filter}(p, s) = \\\\text{hom}_\\\\oplus[\\\\lambda x. \\\\text{if } p(x) \\\\text{ then } \\\\{ x \\\\} \\\\text{ else } \\\\{ \\\\}](s)$. \\nMonoid comprehensions\\n\\nThe concept of monoid homomorphism is useful for expressing a formal semantics of iteration over collections. However, it is not very convenient as a programming construct. A natural notation for such a construct that is both conspicuous and can be expressed in terms of monoid homomorphisms is a monoid comprehension. This notion generalizes the familiar notation used for writing a set in comprehension (as opposed to writing it in extension) using a pattern and a formula describing its elements (as opposed to listing all its elements). For example, the set comprehension \\\\( \\\\{ (x, x^2) \\\\mid x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, \\\\exists n.x = 2n \\\\} \\\\) describes the set of pairs \\\\( (x, x^2) \\\\) (the pattern), verifying the formula \\\\( x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, \\\\exists n.x = 2n \\\\) (the qualifier).\\n\\nThis notation can be extended to any (primitive or collection) monoid \\\\( \\\\oplus \\\\). The syntax of a monoid comprehension is an expression of the form \\\\( \\\\oplus\\\\{e \\\\mid Q\\\\} \\\\) where \\\\( e \\\\) is an expression called the head of the comprehension, and \\\\( Q \\\\) is called its qualifier and is a sequence \\\\( q_1, \\\\ldots, q_n, n \\\\geq 0 \\\\), where each \\\\( q_i \\\\) is either:\\n\\n- a generator of the form \\\\( x \\\\leftarrow e \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a variable and \\\\( e \\\\) is an expression; or,\\n- a filter \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) which is a boolean condition.\\n\\nIn a monoid comprehension expression \\\\( \\\\oplus\\\\{e \\\\mid Q\\\\} \\\\), the monoid operation \\\\( \\\\oplus \\\\) is called the accumulator.\\n\\nAs for semantics, the meaning of a monoid comprehension is defined in terms of monoid homomorphisms.\\n\\n**Definition 2 (Monoid Comprehension).** The meaning of a monoid comprehension over a monoid \\\\( \\\\oplus \\\\) is defined inductively as follows:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n\\\\oplus\\\\{e \\\\mid \\\\} & \\\\equiv \\\\begin{cases} \\n\\\\bigcup_{\\\\oplus}(e) & \\\\text{if } \\\\oplus \\\\text{ is a collection monoid} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\oplus & \\\\text{if } \\\\oplus \\\\text{ is a primitive monoid}\\n\\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\oplus\\\\{e \\\\mid x \\\\leftarrow e', Q\\\\} & \\\\equiv \\\\hom_{\\\\oplus}[\\\\lambda x. \\\\oplus\\\\{e \\\\mid Q\\\\}](e') \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\oplus\\\\{e \\\\mid c, Q\\\\} & \\\\equiv \\\\text{if } c \\\\text{ then } \\\\oplus\\\\{e \\\\mid Q\\\\} \\\\text{ else } 1\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nsuch that \\\\( e : \\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\oplus}, e' : \\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\odot}, \\\\text{ and } \\\\odot \\\\text{ is a collection monoid.} \\\\)\\n\\nNote that although the input monoid \\\\( \\\\oplus \\\\) is explicit, each generator \\\\( x \\\\leftarrow e' \\\\) in the qualifier has an implicit collection monoid \\\\( \\\\odot \\\\) whose characteristics can be inferred with polymorphic typing rules.\\n\\nNote that relational joins are immediately expressible as monoid comprehensions. Indeed, the join of two sets \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) using a function \\\\( f \\\\) and a predicate \\\\( p \\\\) is simply:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nS \\\\bowtie_T^f T \\\\equiv \\\\bigcup\\\\{f(x, y) \\\\mid x \\\\leftarrow S, y \\\\leftarrow T, p(x, y)\\\\}. \\\\tag{52}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nTypically, a relational join will take \\\\( f \\\\) to be a record constructor. For example, if we write a record whose fields \\\\( l_i \\\\) have values \\\\( e_i \\\\) for \\\\( i = 1, \\\\ldots, n \\\\), as \\\\( (l_1 = e_1, \\\\ldots, l_n = e_n) \\\\), then a standard relational join can be obtained with, say, \\\\( f(x, y) = \\\\langle \\\\text{name} = y.\\\\text{name}, \\\\text{age} = 2 * x.\\\\text{age} \\\\rangle \\\\), and \\\\( p(x, y) \\\\) may be any condition such as \\\\( x.\\\\text{name} = y.\\\\text{name}, x.\\\\text{age} \\\\geq 18 \\\\).\\nClearly, monoid comprehensions can immediately express queries using all usual relational operators (and, indeed, object queries as well) and most usual functions. For example,\\n\\n$$\\\\exists x \\\\in s.e \\\\quad \\\\text{def} \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\{ e \\\\mid x \\\\leftarrow s \\\\}$$\\n\\n$$\\\\forall x \\\\in s.e \\\\quad \\\\text{def} \\\\quad \\\\exists \\\\{ e \\\\mid x \\\\leftarrow s \\\\}$$\\n\\n$$x \\\\in s \\\\quad \\\\text{def} \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\{ x = y \\\\mid y \\\\leftarrow s \\\\}$$\\n\\n$$s \\\\cap t \\\\quad \\\\text{def} \\\\quad \\\\exists \\\\{ x \\\\mid x \\\\leftarrow s, x \\\\in t \\\\}$$\\n\\n$$\\\\text{count}(a, s) \\\\quad \\\\text{def} \\\\quad +\\\\{1 \\\\mid x \\\\leftarrow s, x = a\\\\}$$\\n\\n$$\\\\text{filter}(p, s) \\\\quad \\\\text{def} \\\\quad \\\\bigcup\\\\{x \\\\mid x \\\\leftarrow s, p(x)\\\\}$$\\n\\n$$\\\\text{flatten}(s) \\\\quad \\\\text{def} \\\\quad \\\\bigcup\\\\{t \\\\mid t \\\\leftarrow s, x \\\\leftarrow t\\\\}$$\\n\\nNote that some of these functions will work only on appropriate types of their arguments. For example, the type of the argument of \\\\text{sum} must be a non-idempotent monoid, and so must the type of the second argument of \\\\text{count}. Thus, \\\\text{sum} will add up the elements of a bag or a list, and \\\\text{count} will tally the number of occurrences of an element in a bag or a list. Applying either \\\\text{sum} or \\\\text{count} to a set will be caught as a type error.\\n\\nWe are now in a position to propose a programming calculus using monoid comprehensions. Fig. 9 defines an abstract grammar for an expression \\\\(e\\\\) of the \\\\textit{Monoid Comprehension Calculus} and amounts to adding comprehensions to an extended Typed Polymorphic \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\)-Calculus. Fig. 10 gives the typing rules for this calculus.\\n\\n**Fig. 9.** Additional Syntax for the monoid comprehension calculus (with Fig. 7)\\n\\n\\\\[\\ne ::= \\\\ldots \\\\quad \\\\text{extended \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\)-calculus expression}\\n| \\\\text{\\\\(1 \\\\oplus\\\\)} \\\\quad \\\\text{monoid identity}\\n| \\\\text{\\\\(U \\\\oplus\\\\)}(e) \\\\quad \\\\text{monoid unit injection}\\n| e_1 \\\\oplus e_2 \\\\quad \\\\text{monoid composition}\\n| \\\\oplus\\\\{e \\\\mid Q\\\\} \\\\quad \\\\text{monoid comprehension}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n**F  Backend System**\\n\\nOur generic backend system comprises classes for managing runtime events and objects, a display manager, and an error manager. As an example, we describe the organization of a runtime object.\\n\\nThe class \\\\(<\\\\text{backend}.\\\\text{Runtime.java}>\\\\) defines what a runtime context consists of as an object of this class. Such an object serves as the common execution environment context shared by \\\\(<\\\\text{instructions}.\\\\text{Instruction}>\\\\) objects being executed. It encapsulates a state of computation that is effected by each instruction as it is executed in its context.\\n\\nThus, a \\\\(<\\\\text{backend}.\\\\text{Runtime.java}>\\\\) object consists of attributes and structures that together define a state of computation, and methods that are used by instructions\\nFig. 10. Additional typing rules for the monoid comprehension calculus (with Fig. 6)\\n\\nto effect this state as they are executed. Thus, each instruction subclass of \\\\(\\\\text{Instruction}\\\\) defines an execute\\\\((\\\\text{Instruction}, \\\\text{Runtime})\\\\) method that specifies its operational semantics as a state transformation of its given runtime context.\\n\\nInitiating execution of a \\\\(\\\\text{Runtime}.java\\\\) object consists of setting its code array to a given instruction sequence, setting its instruction pointer \\\\(\\\\text{ip}\\\\) to its code\\u2019s first instruction and repeatedly calling and invoking execute\\\\((\\\\text{this})\\\\) on whatever instruction in the current code array for this Runtime.java object is currently at address \\\\(\\\\text{ip}\\\\). The final state is reached when a flag indicating that it is so is set to true. Each instruction is responsible for appropriately setting the next state according to its semantics, including saving and restoring states, and (re)setting the code array and the various runtime registers pointing into the state\\u2019s structures.\\n\\nRuntime states encapsulated by objects in this class are essentially those of a stack automaton, specifically conceived to support the computations of a higher-order functional language with lexical closures\\u2014i.e., a \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\)-Calculus machine\\u2014extended to support additional features\\u2014e.g., assignment side-effects, objects, automatic currying... As such it may viewed as an optimized variant of Peter Landin\\u2019s SECD machine [30]\\u2014in the same spirit as Luca Cardelli\\u2019s Functional Abstract Machine (FAM) [16], although our design is quite different from Cardelli\\u2019s in its structure and operations.\\nBecause this is a Java implementation, in order to avoid the space and performance overhead of being confined to boxed values for primitive type computations, three concurrent sets of structures are maintained: in addition to those needed for boxed (Java object) values, two extra ones are used to support unboxed integer and floating-point values, respectively. The runtime operations performed by instructions on a \\\\texttt{Runtime} object are guaranteed to be type-safe in that each state is always such as it must be expected for the correct accessing and setting of values. Such a guarantee must be (and is!) provided by the \\\\texttt{TypeChecker} and the \\\\texttt{Sanitizer}, which ascertain all the conditions that must be met prior to having a \\\\texttt{Compiler} proceed to generating instructions which will safely act on the appropriate stacks and environments of the correct sort (integer, floating-point, or object).\\n\\nDisplay manager objects and error manager objects are similarly organized.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

There is a lifetime increased risk from autoimmune conditions like hypothyroidism, coeliac disease, hearing loss and aortic dilatation with the potential to lead to aortic dissection. A systematic and holistic approach to provision of health care in TS is needed.\\n\\nAreas of controversy: Several unanswered questions remain, including the choice of hormone replacement therapy in the young person with TS and in adulthood; the optimal mode of cardiovascular assessment; the best management and assessment prior to and during pregnancy.\\n\\nAreas timely for developing research: The optimal model of care and transition to adult services in TS requires attention. Further research is needed in relation to cardiovascular risk assessment, pregnancy management and hormone replacement therapy in TS.\\n\\nKey words: Turner syndrome, transition, hormone replacement therapy, puberty, pregnancy, aortic dissection, aortic dilatation\\nBackground\\n\\nTurner syndrome (TS) is a condition in phenotypic girls and women with a lack of one or part of one sex chromosome and affects ~1/2500 live female births. While short stature, hypogonadism and typical dysmorphic features are commonly recognized clinical features, a range of medical problems can exist across the age span (Table 1). Paediatric management has often focussed on the use of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to improve linear growth and the timely use of sex steroid to mimic normal pubertal development. Medical issues like aortic dilatation (AD) and dissection, bone health, hearing loss, liver dysfunction, autoimmune conditions and cancer risks may have a major impact on the life of these girls and women. With the advent of modern techniques of assisted reproduction technologies, many TS women are seeking the opportunity for childbearing. However, associated medical problems such as AD and autoimmune conditions (e.g. undiagnosed hypothyroidism) may contribute to significant risks in these pregnancies. It is, therefore, imperative that a comprehensive health assessment in girls with TS is performed at the time of transition and continues to be addressed in adulthood by clinicians cognizant with the unique and inter-related issues encountered by these women. Careful counselling of these young individuals and their families at this critical period is also imperative.\\n\\nIt is accepted that the diagnosis of TS is reached with standard banded karyotype, counting 15\\u201330 cells. If low-level mosaicism is suspected, increasing the number of cell count to 100 cells may be necessary, which allows for detection of 3% mosaicism at 95% confidence levels. Only ~50% of TS individuals have a 45, X karyotype and 40% will have a structural abnormality of the second X chromosome. Approximately 30% of TS will have a mosaic peripheral blood karyotype, where a 45,X cell line coexists with one non-45, X cell line. Importantly, 10% of women with TS have mosaisms for a cell line with a normal or abnormal Y chromosome. The risk of gonadoblastoma in these individuals is estimated to be ~30% and early gonadectomy is recommended. The majority of TS with mosaic karyotype will not have the classical features of TS, and a low threshold for investigations is encouraged to avoid late diagnosis. In many genetic laboratories, DNA microarrays are increasingly used to make the diagnosis of TS. The accuracy of detection of low-level mosaicism and Y chromosome material is still unclear.\\n\\nCurrent expert consensus recommends performing karyotype in girls with any of the following: short stature, delayed puberty, webbed neck, lymphoedema, inner ear problems and coarctation of aorta (CoA). The prevalence of TS in girls presenting with short stature is between 2 and 4%, and its prevalence in girls presenting with CoA is at least 5%. Delayed diagnosis of TS in adolescence and beyond is still seen in ~20% of diagnosed cases. This clinical review aims to summarize the important health issues that need to be considered by a clinician preparing a young person with TS for transition to adult care.\\n\\nPubertal development in TS\\n\\nTS is associated with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, as a consequence of premature ovarian failure. Approximately 30% of girls with TS enter puberty spontaneously, but only ~4% reach menarche and only 1% are fertile. Almost 90% will require hormone replacement therapy either to initiate and/or to ensure progress in puberty, maintain secondary sexual development and promote bone health. The pattern of gonadotrophins (Gn) secretion in TS is similar to that observed in normal pre-pubertal girls, but serum concentrations are consistently higher at all pre-pubertal ages. Assessment of ovarian function in childhood using Gn may be unhelpful due to the relative quiescence of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis. Concentration of antimullerian hormone (AMH), produced by granulosa cell, has been found to remain stable from mid-childhood to early adulthood and can be used to evaluate ovarian function throughout the age range. AMH may help predict those girls who will achieve spontaneous onset of puberty and normal pubertal progress as well as the presence of healthy follicles.\\n\\nSex steroid replacement in TS\\n\\nThe optimal regimen for sex steroid replacement for induction of puberty in TS remains a controversial\\n| Table 1 Clinical features in Turner syndrome |\\n|--------------------------------------------|\\n| **Neonate and childhood** | **Adolescence and adult age** |\\n| **Specific physical features** | **Neonate:** | **Short stature** |\\n| -

The main goals of sex steroid replacement in puberty are to ensure (i) adequate breast development, (ii) pubertal growth spurt, (iii) adequate uterine development and (iv) bone accrual for adequate peak bone mass. Our current clinical practice for pubertal induction is summarized in Table 2.\\n\\nFor a more comprehensive review on aspects on the area of sex steroid replacement in TS, the reader is referred to two recent excellent reviews of the topic.15,16 Generally, oestrogen is initiated around the age of 12\\u201313 years if there are no signs of breast development or progression in pubertal status. The combined effect of rhGH and low doses of oestrogens seems to influence height velocity in a favourable way, while supra-physiological oestrogen doses given too early might limit the GH-dependent gain in final height.17,18 Oestrogen is gradually increased over a 2\\u20133 year period to mimic the physiological rise in levels to ensure adequate breast development and pubertal growth spur. Delaying sex steroid treatment until the completion of linear growth, a practice common previously, undervalues the psychosocial importance of age-appropriate pubertal maturation and may be deleterious to bone development and other aspects of the child\\u2019s health.19 Healthy pre-pubertal girls, in fact, secrete low but measurable amount of oestradiol.20,21 Given the effects of oestrogen on various target organs, it is thought that delaying sex steroid replacement to >12 years may lead to unfavourable clinical outcome. A recent randomized placebo trial of ultra-low-dose oral ethinyl oestradiol introduced as young as 5 years show that it may lead to more physiological onset of pubertal development, more favourable augmentation of rhGH growth and benefits for cognition.22,23 This is not conventional practise and further research is needed.\\n\\nOptimizing uterine growth is fundamental in improving success rates of pregnancy in the future. The window of opportunity (during puberty and post-pubertal/pre-conception) and outcome in TS is unclear. In the UK, oral ethinyl oestradiol commencing at 2 \\u00b5g daily at age 12\\u201313 years is commonly used. This leads to satisfactory pubertal induction and maintenance, but may fail to induce a fully mature uterus in about half of the affected population without spontaneous pubertal onset.12 The ethinyl component of ethinyl oestradiol also induces prorenin substrate product at a much higher rate than natural oestrogen and may lead to an increase in blood pressure in a cohort of patient where hypertension is relatively common.24\\n\\nThere are also possible advantages of transdermal oestrogen over oral oestrogen including a more physiologic delivery, decreased first past metabolism and higher systemic IGF1 levels with possible consequent improvement in metabolism and body composition.25\\u201327 While studies in adult hypopituitary and postmenopausal women treated with oral 17\\u03b2-oestradiol showed reduction in IGF1 levels, with\\n\\n| Age (years) | Aim of therapy |\\n|------------|----------------|\\n| 12+        | Pubertal induction (suggested doses): |\\n|            | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |\\n| Oral ethinyloestradiol (\\u00b5g) |          |        |        |\\n| Patch 17\\u03b2-oestradiol (\\u00b5g) | 6.25   | 12.5   | 25     |\\n|            | 50\\u00b0    | 50     |        |\\n| 15+        | Completion of puberty (suggested doses): |\\n| Oral ethinyloestradiol (\\u00b5g) | 20\\u201330\\u00b0 | 50\\u2013100\\u00b0 |\\n| Patch 17\\u03b2-oestradiol (\\u00b5g) |        |        |\\n\\n*Norethisterone 5 mg daily for the first 5 days of each calendar month when ethinyloestradiol reaches 10 \\u00b5g daily, or when breakthrough bleeding occurs, whichever is the sooner.*\\nconsequent reduction in lipid oxidation, whole-body protein synthesis, lean mass and increase in fat mass, less is known about the effects of oral oestrogen in childhood and puberty. In girls with short stature, oral 17\\u03b2-oestradiol leads to reduction in IGF1 levels following short-term rhGH injections as part of the IGF generation test. However, a pilot, randomized controlled trial of oral conjugated oestrogen vs. transdermal 17\\u03b2-oestradiol for pubertal induction in 12 girls with TS showed no differences in systemic IGF1 levels. Transdermal 17\\u03b2-oestradiol however led to better bone accrual and increased uterine growth compared with oral conjugated oestrogen.\\n\\nTable 3 summarizes the currently published studies of pubertal induction with oestrogen on uterine development in TS. The summary highlights the heterogeneity of the current published studies (number of cases, study design, oestrogen regime). It is, however, noteworthy that most were commenced on oestrogen relatively late. One recent randomized controlled trial show that transdermal 17\\u03b2-oestradiol used to induce puberty in TS was superior to oral conjugated oestrogen with regards to uterine development. A study in 25 adult women (including 7 with TS) with primary hypogonadism showed that women managed with transdermal oestrogen containing 17\\u03b2-oestradiol (Estraderm patches) showed a trend towards increase in uterine volumes compared with an oral contraceptive pill containing ethinyl oestradiol (Loestrin 30). These early studies point to the possible benefit of transdermal oestrogen for pubertal induction and replacement therapy, and there may still be an opportunity to optimize uterine volume post puberty, although the magnitude of this is currently unknown.\\n\\nAt the end of this period of increasing doses of oestrogen, progesterone is added at least every 3 months to allow endometrial shedding, although some girls may prefer a monthly bleed. In the UK, common forms of oestrogen replacement post induction of puberty are the oral contraceptive pill, oral oestrogen/oral progesterone, combined transdermal patch and transdermal patch/oral oestrogen. Decisions of ongoing oestrogen replacement need to be carefully discussed with the young person and family during transition and management may need to be individualized.\\n\\nFrom a cardiovascular point of view, oral oestrogen replacement may be associated with a higher risk of hypertension, stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and coronary heart disease in predisposed women. In comparison with a 12-month oral regimen (ethinylestradiol 30.0 \\u00b5g and norethisterone 1.5 mg daily for Weeks 1\\u20133, followed by 7 \\u2018pill-free\\u2019 days), physiological replacement with transdermal oestrogen (transdermal oestradiol 100 \\u00b5g daily for Week 1 and 150 \\u00b5g for Weeks 2\\u20134 plus oral or vaginal passaries of progesterone 200 mg twice daily in Weeks 3\\u20134) resulted in lower blood pressure, better renal function (plasma angiotensin II and serum creatinine concentrations) and less activation of the renin-angiotensin system in women with premature ovarian failure. These differences potentially have major consequences for the future long-term cardiovascular risk in TS. Oral oestrogens are unable to reach the systemic circulation directly and are usually first metabolized by intestine and liver. Thus, the liver is exposed to a higher dose of oestrogen than the rest of the body, stimulating the production of hepatic proteins as renin substrate, which may exacerbate hypertension and triggering changes between antithrombotic mechanisms and pro-coagulant factors. Although VTE can occur at any time, the risk is highest in the first year of treatment. Both the risk for VTE and education regarding thrombosis prevention should be discussed with the young person and her family. Transdermal oestradiol and micronized progesterone are preferable for girls with TS who have an increased risk of VTE, but these need to be balanced against the possibility of poor adherence with transdermal treatment.\\n\\n**Bone health**\\n\\nAs discussed earlier, appropriate timing of introduction of oestrogen for induction of puberty in TS is needed for achievement of peak bone mass. Oestrogen stimulates endocortical formation with resultant narrowing of the medullary cavity. Bone health is thought to be variably affected in TS, although older studies using dual energy absorptiometry (DXA) evaluation have not adjusted for the relative short stature of these individuals. Thus, TS individuals are\\n| Reference       | Study design            | Number of subjects | Mean/Median age starting oestrogen | Form of oestrogen and dose | Outcome                                                                 |\\n|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| **Effect of pubertal induction regimen on uterine outcome** |                         |                    |                                   |                           |                                                                         |\\n| Nabhan et al.   | Randomized controlled trial | 12 (6 in each group) | 14 years                         | Oral CE: 0.3 increasing to 0.625 mg/day Transdermal E (TE): 0.025 increasing to 0.0375 mg/day | \\u2191 uterine length in TE (66% mature uterus in TE, 0% mature uterus in oral CE) |\\n| Kim et al.      | Retrospective           | 9                  | 14.5 years                       | Oral EV: 0.5\\u20132 mg increasing Oral EV: 1\\u20132 mg increasing | Oral EV 1 mg \\u2191 uterine size (50% mature uterus in 1 mg group, 22% mature uterus in 0.5 mg group) |\\n| Cleemann et al. | Cross-sectional         | 41                 | 13 years                         | Oral E: 0.1\\u20131.75 mg increasing | Mature adult shaped fundo-cervical ratio uterus in 79.5%                   |\\n| Bannink et al.  | Prospective non-randomized | 56                | 12.7 years                       | Oral E: 5 \\u00b5g/kg/day increasing to 10 \\u00b5g/kg/day | \\u2191 uterine volume                                                        |\\n| Piippo et al.   | Prospective non-randomized | 23                | 13.6 years                       | Oral E: 0.1 mg/day increasing to 1.5 mg/day | Normal uterine size                                                     |\\n| Doerr et al.    | Prospective non-randomized | 75                | 14.7 years                       | Oral EE                        | \\u2191 uterine volume, but no group details.

In addition, some older reports may have included individuals who had very late introduction of oestrogen for pubertal induction. Table 3 summarizes the currently published studies of pubertal induction with oestrogen on bone development.\\n\\nFor adequate maintenance of bone health in adulthood, the conventional use of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) may be contraindicated and may lead to ongoing bone loss as the woman with TS will be oestrogen deficient for 7 days out of the 30-day cycle. In some countries, there is now an OCP which allows for only two oestrogen-free days. The degree of possible bone loss in TS on either of these regimes is unknown. Identifying and managing other associated clinical conditions that may predispose to further insults to bone health in TS including coeliac disease (CD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and thyroid dysfunction is also important.\\n\\nA recent study revealed that TS adolescents (mean 13 years) may have lower size adjusted bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) at femoral neck but not at lumbar spine and lower cortical volumetric bone density on peripheral quantitative computer tomography. Most TS individuals under 13 years of age are unlikely to have completed puberty, whereas the majority of the reference group of girls would have achieved menarche at that age with a significant increase in bone mass accrual. A more recent study in adults (mean age 30 years) showed that trabecular microarchitecture however may be abnormal in TS. Currently, it is unclear whether the bone abnormalities in TS are related to adequacy of oestrogen replacement or whether it is also a non-progressive phenotype of the skeletal dysplasia associated with the syndrome. Longitudinal studies of bone mass in adults with TS especially in relation to HRT regimes are now needed.\\n\\n**Pregnancy and fertility**\\n\\nSpontaneous pregnancies are very rare (2%) in women with TS. The likelihood of functional ovarian tissue and fertility in women with TS relies on the presence of 46,XX germ cells in the ovaries and is therefore more likely in women with mosaicism.\\n\\nAdvances in reproductive medicine, involving *In Vitro Fertilization\\u2014Embryo Transfer* (IVF-ET), have increased the possibility of childbearing in infertile women with TS, but pregnancy remains particularly challenging due to the high prevalence of serious, life-threatening cardiovascular complications such as aortic dissection (AoD).\\n\\nDespite recent advances, there is an excess of foetal malformations, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, prematurity and perinatal death in the offspring of mothers with TS irrespective of the method of conception, due to chromosomal and uterine abnormalities. However, a recent report of 106 TS women has provided more favourable neonatal outcome data, with a preterm birth rate of 8% and a low birth weight rate of \\u223c9% in singletons. Major birth defects were found in 4% of the children, not different from pregnancies after conventional IVF and better than previously reported. The perinatal mortality was 2%, including a set of extremely preterm twins. Maternal risks were high in this group, particularly in the development of hypertensive disorders. Heterologous IVF-ET, using oocyte donation, is the most used reproductive technique and it represents the only way to become pregnant for the vast majority of such women in whom ovarian failure is likely to be established at the time of starting a family. A review of 23 women with TS following ovum donation reported a miscarriage rate of 44% and take home baby rate of 18% per transfer. In a further cohort of 30 women following oocyte donation, 26% of clinical pregnancies ended in miscarriage, much lower than the miscarriage rate of 45% using the patient\\u2019s own gametes.\\n\\nWomen with mosaic TS may also benefit from cryopreservation of patient\\u2019s own oocytes for fertility preservation before decline in ovarian function. A report regarding 57 TS girls has informed the selection criteria among girls with TS who would be candidates and should be offered sampling and storing of ovarian tissue for cryopreservation. This report concluded that at the age of 13\\u201314 years, girls with TS should be counselled about fertility options and, in those with mosaic karyotype and spontaneous puberty in the absence of any elevation in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or reduction in AMH, the\\ndiscussion should include cryopreservation. Harvesting of oocytes or ovarian tissue from girls with TS for storage is technically possible, but these techniques remain experimental and have as yet not been associated with reported pregnancies published in the literature as far as we are aware.\\n\\n**Cardiovascular health**\\n\\nCongenital heart disease (CHD) is a common association of TS and reported in up to 50%. Bicuspid aortic valves (BAV), CoA and AD significantly contribute to the risk of AoD, although in 10% of reported cases no risk factors were reported. Hypertension is also relatively common and may require careful evaluation with 24 h blood pressure monitoring. AoD in TS, 6 times commoner than in healthy individuals, occurs frequently in the third decade as opposed to the seventh decade, although paediatric cases are seen. Symptoms are often non-specific including chest pain, non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms and musculoskeletal complaints but also change in phonation due to compression on recurrent laryngeal nerves, highlighting the importance of early recognition by TS individuals and medical staff. A recent comprehensive review on AD and dissection in TS includes a thorough review of the 122 published cases of AoD in these individuals. As discussed in the previous section, pregnancy is a critical period. The risk of mortality from AoD alone during pregnancy in TS is in excess of 100 times the population risk. The highest risk period during pregnancy is the third trimester although several cases reported have dissected within the first 2 weeks post-partum BAV, the commonest cardiovascular system (CVS) pathology, is seen in ~20% of individuals, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveal a spectrum of other abnormal aortic valves. CoA presenting with neonatal collapse, often but not universally associated with low birth weight and pedal oedema seen in ~4\\u201312% of infants, may be the most well-recognized cardiac pathology. CoA may also present later in life with uncontrolled hypertension, or limb claudication diagnosed only on MRI.\\n\\nOngoing CVS monitoring of all individuals with TS throughout adult life and during pregnancy is recommended. Careful re-evaluation using MRI or detailed echocardiogram should be performed in adolescence before transfer to adult care to allow for appropriate counselling of risk. MRI should be used in adults and older adolescents with broad chests as adequate views are often not obtained with echocardiogram. Evaluation with MRI for evaluation of aortic arch dimensions may be better with MRI. Given that most girls with TS are relatively short even with rhGH therapy, aortic dimensions need to adjust for body surface area called aortic sized index (ASI). There is now sufficient evidence that TS with ASI of >2.0 and >2.5 cm/m\\u00b2 is at high risk and very high risk of AoD, respectively. New data propose a mathematical model incorporating aortic dimensions and other clinical factors to identify TS individuals at greatest risk for AoD, although this is not validated against the clinical outcome of AoD.\\n\\nDespite the recognized importance of CVS monitoring, the majority of TS individuals do not currently have CVS monitoring. One study reported that only 40% of those undergoing oocyte donation had any form of CVS evaluation. A single-centre approach with involvement of one endocrinologist and cardiologist on the other hand showed that ~70% of TS women had evaluation with echocardiogram and MRI. Despite the recognition of ongoing monitoring, several controversies exist in particular to CVS issues especially during pregnancy. Two international expert consensus differ in recommendations of CVS risk contraindicating pregnancy in TS (Table 4), and it is in this respect that further research and local consistencies in advice is needed.\\n\\nWe believe that TS individuals should be reviewed by cardiologists with experience in assessment of these girls and women, ideally by the Congenital Heart Disease Team. In a recent study, 40% of women with TS had abnormal cardiovascular findings which may preclude pregnancy when assessed by cardiologist with expertise in TS after having had normal assessments by previous cardiologists not familiar with TS.\\n\\n**Other health and psychosocial issues**\\n\\nAutoimmune and inflammatory conditions are commoner in TS. Hypothyroidism occurs in up to 30%,\\nwhereas thyrotoxicosis occurs in \\\\( \\\\sim 1.6\\\\% \\\\). Diabetes mellitus is also more common, which may be associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Abnormal glucose homeostasis in TS may be due to a combination of reduced insulin response to glucose load, reduced insulin sensitivity and reduced beta cell function, suggesting that it is maybe a specific disorder unique to TS. Coeliac disease is seen in \\\\( \\\\sim 2-10\\\\% \\\\) of TS although usually asymptomatic. An increased risk of IBD is also seen in TS, especially those with i(Xq) lineage. Abnormal liver function with raised ALT and GGT is thought to be related to hepatic steatosis and also small intrahepatic vascular anomalies. It was previously thought that oestrogen therapy may have a contributing role, but recent studies in fact show that mild improvement may be seen with oestrogen therapy. Regular screening for thyroid disease, liver dysfunction and CD is recommended and imperative pre-conception.\\n\\nOtitis media, middle ear effusions often requiring grommets insertion and subsequent cholesteatoma are recognized complications of paediatric girls with TS. ENT surgeons, general practitioners, general paediatricians and physicians should consider the diagnosis of TS in a girl or woman with a history of ongoing ENT problems like recurrent otitis media, recurrent grommets insertion and cholesteatoma. Less well recognized is the progressive hearing loss, usually in the high frequency region, especially after the age of 30 years. The rate of decline in TS women aged 30\\u201360 years is equivalent to those of 70\\u201380 years in non-TS women. Women with TS appear to be at increased risk of cancers especially CNS tumours, bladder and urethral cancers. The increased risk of CNS tumours appears to be from non-malignant tumours like meningioma. Currently, there is no information on the relationship of risk with hormone therapy. While most girls and women with TS have normal intellect, \\\\( \\\\sim 10\\\\% \\\\) may require special education and assistance. The majority, however, have specific learning difficulties involving non-verbal, perceptual, motor and visuospatial skills, which translates to difficulties in such aspects such as mathematics, driving, multitasking and social functioning especially reading social cues. Impaired peer relationship, higher anxiety, inflexibility, low self-esteem and preoccupation with keeping things in order are often reported.\\n\\n### Table 4 International expert consensus in recommendations of CVS risk contraindicating pregnancy in TS\\n\\n| Consensus | Recommendations | Criteria |\\n|-----------|-----------------|----------|\\n| American Society for Reproductive Medicine (2012) | Absolute contraindication | Any significant cardiac abnormality and/or ASI >2 cm/m\\u00b2 |\\n| French College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (2010) | Contraindication | History of aortic surgery |\\n| | | Previous aortic dissection |\\n| | | Aortic dilatation (ASI >2.5 cm/m\\u00b2 or absolute dimensions >3.5 cm) |\\n| | | Coarctation of aorta |\\n| | | Uncontrolled hypertension despite medical treatment |\\n\\n**An approach for provision of coordinated care**\\n\\nProvision of health care to the adolescent and adult with TS needs to be holistic and should address both the medical and non-medical aspects of the patient. Access to clinicians and allied health professionals aware of the complex and inter-related issues impacting on health of these individuals is needed. Support for TS individuals and families from TS support groups should be strongly encouraged and provides families with a source of valuable information. Often families may not wish to be involved with support groups at diagnosis, but this should be discussed again during adolescence as the young person may wish to be involved with other individuals with\\nTS. Specific needs of the TS young person and adult should be individualized with access to nurse specialist, psychologist and educational support. During the period of transition, addressing and paying attention to aspects relating to navigational planning and visuomotor integration may be necessary for a range of important day-to-day aspects of life such as driving training, choosing future career options and also organizing aspects of individual health care like medication and attendance in clinic. Psychosocial support is often lacking, but it should be an important part of clinical care of these girls and women. Group psychological intervention may improve self-esteem and generic skills in these young people.64\\n\\nA comprehensive health evaluation should be performed in late adolescence prior to transition. These investigations should identify important health issues prior to transition to adult care (Table 5). In addition, crucial investigations from careful cardiovascular evaluation will allow appropriate risk of AoD, especially during pregnancies. We believe that these issues should be discussed in adolescence by the treating paediatric team rather than deferring such discussions to the adult clinic, given the possibility of loss to follow-up during the transition period. However, there may be a case to conduct such investigations (e.g. cardiac MRI) once the young person is in the adult setting to ensure consistency of information and reporting given the need for future repeat evaluations. Discussion of such important issues may need to be individualized to the developmental maturity of each young person with TS. Close working relationship with adult clinicians and other paediatric subspecialties who may be involved in the care of the young person and adult with TS is needed to ensure consistencies in advice of some of the more unclear aspects of management of these individuals. Young adults with TS should be managed in dedicated TS clinics or by clinicians aware of the complex health issues encountered by these individuals and with\\n\\nTable 5 Suggested assessment in Turner syndrome prior to pubertal induction and transition\\n\\n| Category           | Childhood                                           | Young person\\u2014prior to transition                      |\\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Auxology           | Height, weight                                      | Height/weight                                        |\\n|                    | Pubertal assessment (from 10 years)                 | Pubertal assessment                                  |\\n| Growth hormone     | IGF1 and bone age (if on growth hormone therapy)    | Thyroid function                                     |\\n| monitoring         | Thyroid function                                    |                                                      |\\n| Ovarian reserve    | FSH, AMH (at diagnosis)                             | Pelvic ultrasound                                    |\\n|                    | Pelvic ultrasound (prior to pubertal induction)      | Counsel young person and family regarding fertility   |\\n| Cardiovascular     | Cardiac assessment and echocardiogram (diagnosis)    | Cardiac assessment, echocardiogram \\u00b1 MRI              |\\n|                    | Blood pressure (every clinic)                       | Blood pressure                                       |\\n| Bone               | Examine for scoliosis (before commencing growth hormone and annually) | DXA scan                                             |\\n| Autoimmune         | Thyroid peroxidase antibody (diagnosis)             | Thyroid function                                     |\\n|                    | Thyroid function (diagnosis and then annually if on growth hormone) | Coeliac screen                                       |\\n|                    | Coeliac screen (12 years)                           |                                                      |\\n| ENT                | Hearing test (diagnosis)                            | Hearing test                                         |\\n| Renal              | ENT referral if appropriate                         |                                                      |\\n|                    | Renal ultrasound (diagnosis)                        |                                                      |\\n| Liver              | Urine culture if any renal abnormalities             | Liver function                                       |\\n| Metabolic          | Liver function (12 years)                           | Fasting glucose, lipids, HbA1C                       |\\n| Psychosocial       | Review school performance                           | Vocational advice                                    |\\naccess to other health professionals.

This requires multidisciplinary care with a systematic approach to screen for associated medical conditions but individualized to address the needs of each young person with TS. Medical and non-medical aspects of TS girls and women need to be addressed in ongoing health-care provision by clinicians familiar with the spectrum of problems encountered by these women. Families and the young person should be made aware of the TS support group. Engaging TS women with ongoing follow-up in adulthood and regular health surveillance remains a challenging area.\\n\\n**Conflict of Interest statement**\\n\\nThe authors have no potential conflicts of interest.\\n\\n**References**\\n\\n1.

The genes in the toxin gene cluster are currently being identified and characterized. In this study, a genomic cosmid clone, pcAFT-2, was structurally characterized. This cosmid contains AFT homologs, which were found to be involved in AF-toxin biosynthesis. These homologs were designated AFTR-2 and AFT3-2. Four new open reading frames (ORFs) (AFT9-1, AFT10-1, AFT11-1, AFT12-1) and two transposon-like sequences (TLS-S4, TLS-S5) were also identified. These ORFs were shown to encode for polyketide synthase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, P450 monooxygenase, and an oxidoreductase, respectively. Transcripts of all the ORFs were detected. DNA gel blot analysis detected homologs of these four ORFs only in the tangerine, strawberry, and Japanese pear pathotypes, which share a common 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid moiety in their toxin structure. Targeting of AFT10-1, which encodes an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, produced single- and double-copy mutants with highly reduced numbers of lesions on host leaves concomitant with reduced toxin production, confirming its role in pathogenicity. Thus, AFT10-1 exists in multiple copies in the genome of Alternaria alternata; and based on the presence of homologs in the tangerine and Japanese pear pathotypes, it is involved in the formation of the 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid moiety of the toxin molecule.\\n\\nKey words Alternaria alternata strawberry pathotype \\u00b7 Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACD) \\u00b7 Host-specific toxin (HST)\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nHost-specific toxins (HSTs) are agents of virulence produced by certain fungal pathogens such as the genera Alternaria and Cochliobolus (Kohmoto and Otani 1991; Walton and Panaccione 1993). Alternaria alternata is a saprophyte or a weak pathogen on a number of plants (Nishimura et al. 1979). Even during host\\u2013pathogen interactions, hyphal ingress can be halted in the cell wall or in the lumen of plants. Thus, the differentiation of specialized pathogens from opportunistic pathogens may depend on the production of host-specific or host-selective toxins (McRoberts and Lennard 1996; Nishimura and Kohmoto 1983); thus, the function and biosynthesis of HSTs has gained much attention (Thomma 2003).\\n\\nIn Alternaria, host-specific toxins are involved in at least 10 plant diseases (Akamatsu et al. 1999). Generally, HSTs have been proposed to act directly on the plasmalemma or mitochondria of sensitive cells (Yoder 1980). In this species, HSTs are classified into groups in terms of the primary site of action; the first group consists of ACT-, AF-, and AK-toxins produced by tangerine, strawberry, and Japanese pear pathotypes of A. alternata, respectively. These toxins share a common 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid structure (Kohmoto et al. 1993; Nakashima et al. 1985; Nakatsuka et al. 1986), suggesting that these toxins share a common biochemical pathway. Genes controlling AK-toxin biosynthesis in the Japanese pear pathotype have been cloned, and their homologs were also found in the tangerine and strawberry pathotypes (Masunaka et al. 2000; Tanaka et al. 1999; Tanaka and Tsuge 2000).\\n\\nS.

This pathogen produces AF-toxins I, II, and III (Fig. 1). AF-toxin I is thought to be the major toxin based on its role in pathogenesis (Yamamoto et al. 1984, 2000). AF-toxin I is toxic to the strawberry cultivar and to certain cultivars of the Japanese pear. AF-toxin II is active on Japanese pear only; and AF-toxin III is toxic to strawberry and less toxic to Japanese pear (Maekawa et al. 1984).\\n\\nPreviously, cosmid clones containing AKT homologs were screened in the NAF8 isolate of *Alternaria alternata* strawberry pathotype. One of the cosmid clones, pcAFT-1, was characterized and was found to contain three AKT homologs designated AFT1-1, AFTR-1, and AFT3-1. Targeting of AFT1-1 and AFT3-1 produced AF-toxin-minus, nonpathogenic mutants that lacked a 1.05-Mb chromosome encoding these AFT genes (Hatta et al. 2002). Another gene, AFTS1, which is also found in this cosmid clone and encodes an enzyme of the aldo-ketoreductase family, is involved specifically in the formation of AF-toxin I (Ito et al. 2004).\\n\\nIn this study, another cosmid clone, pcAFT-2, was characterized. This cosmid clone contains homologs of AKTR and AKT3 designated AFTR-2 and AFT3-2 in the strawberry pathotype. Four new open reading frames (ORFs) were also identified that potentially encode for a polyketide synthase (PKS), an acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, and an oxidoreductase. Southern blots using probes corresponding to these new ORFs suggest that they are found only in the strawberry, Japanese pear, and tangerine pathotypes. The results of this study suggest that these four genes may be involved in biosynthesis of the 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid structure of the AF-, AK-, and AC-toxins.\\n\\nOne of the genes in pcAFT-2, AFT10-1, encodes an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. This FAD-containing enzyme is implicated in \\u03b2-oxidation in fungi and higher plants (Masterson et al. 2000; Richmond and Bleecker 1999; van Roermund et al. 1998). One important product of \\u03b2-oxidation is acetyl-CoA, which is used for the biosynthesis of various products including polyketides, which are secondary fungal metabolites (Brown et al. 1996). To determine the function of AFT10-1 in the pathogenesis and toxin production in *Alternaria alternata* strawberry pathotype, disruption vectors were constructed to disrupt two copies of the gene. Single- and double-copy mutants produced by double crossover homologous recombination events produced less toxin and fewer lesions on strawberry and Japanese pear leaves. This study shows that an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is involved in the pathogenicity of *Alternaria alternata* strawberry pathotype.\\n\\n### Materials and methods\\n\\n#### Fungal isolates and plants\\n\\nThe fungal isolates (Table 1) were maintained on potato sucrose agar (PSA) and kept at 25\\u00b0C. The susceptible strawberry cultivar Morioka-16 and the Japanese pear cultivar Nijisseiki were used in the pathogenicity tests.\\n\\n#### Pathogenicity test and determination of penetration behavior\\n\\nPathogenicity tests were performed as described previously (Maekawa et al. 1984; Tanaka et al. 1999). Lesions were counted, and the average number of lesions per square centimeter of leaf was determined. Penetration behavior was observed by placing spore suspensions (10^3 spores/ml) on cellophane sheets mounted on glass slides. The slides were then incubated in a moist chamber for 24-48h and observed with a light microscope. Germinated and ungerminated conidia were then counted. Appressorial formation and formation of penetration hyphae were also noted.\\n\\n### Table 1.

Colonies that formed were picked up and transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates containing hygromycin B or geneticin at 100\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)g/ml.\\n\\nCosmid and plasmids\\n\\nThe cosmid clone pcAFT-2 contains the genomic sequences of isolate NAF8 of Alternaria alternata and the AKT homologs from the Japanese pear pathotype with c. 31-kb region upstream of the AKTR homolog (Hatta et al. 2002). The pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used to subclone AFT10-1, AFT11-1, AFT12-1, and AFT9-1.\\n\\nThe disruption vectors used were p24 (Fig. 2B) and pACD2 (Fig. 2C). The p24 was produced by first amplifying the AFT10-1 ORF using the primers C2SR19 and C2SR21 and subcloning the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment into a pGEM-T Easy vector to produce the plasmid p41ACD. The hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) gene cassette from the plasmid pSH75 (Kimura and Tsuge 1993) was excised using EcoRI and PvuII and ligated into the EcoRI-linearized p41ACD to form the disruption vector p24. Two sets of primers were used for constructing pACD2: primers C2SR21B and ACD2E, which add BglII and EcoRI restriction sites to the ACD fragment, and C2SR19H and ACD1X, which add HindIII and XbaI cutting sites. The fragments produced were 871bp and 932bp, respectively. To ensure that these restriction sites were added to the fragments during amplification, the PCR products were subcloned in a pGEM-T Easy vector to form the plasmid pBE and pXH, respectively. The pBE was digested with BglII and EcoRI to release the insert. This fragment was then ligated into pII99 vector (Namiki et al. 2001) containing a neomycin phosphotransferase (npt) gene cassette digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was pBE8. The insert from pXH was reisolated using HindIII and XbaI and was ligated into HindIII- and XbaI-digested pBE8 to form the disruption vector pACD2. The primers used are listed in Table 2.\\n\\nDNA manipulations\\n\\nFor DNA isolation, Alternaria alternata isolates were grown on PSA plates for 2\\u20133 days at 25\\\\(^\\\\circ\\\\)C. DNA was then isolated as described previously (Tanaka et al. 1999). For Southern blotting, genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes and fractionated on agarose gels using standard procedures (Sambrook et al. 1989). Probes were labeled using an AlkPhos Direct Labelling kit (Amersham-Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA), and hybridizations were done according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. Detection was done using the CDP Star detection kit. The blots were then exposed in an imager (Fluor-S Max MultiImager; BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) for 2h.

Sequence data were obtained using a fluorescent DNA sequencer (DSQ1000L; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). DNA sequences were analyzed with BLAST (Altschul et al. 1997) and Vector NTI (Infomax, Tokyo, Japan). mRNA was then extracted from the total RNA using the Oligotex\\u2013dT30 (Super) mRNA Purification kit (Toyko, Japan). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was then performed using the Qiagen RT-PCR kit (Takara Biochemicals, Shiga, Japan). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was then performed using the Qiagen RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Primer pairs C2SR10/C2SR11, C2SR19/C2SR21, C2SR22/C2SR25, and C2SR26/C2SR27 were used for amplifying AFT9-1, AFT10-1, AFT11-1, and AFT12-1, respectively.\\n\\nToxin production\\n\\nWild-type and mutant strains were grown on 10 ml potato sucrose broth for 7 days without agitation and incubated at 25\\u00b0C. Mycelial mats and culture filtrates were then harvested. Culture filtrates were used to quantify AF-toxins I and II by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis as previously described (Hayashi et al. 1990). AF-toxin III was not quantified because it is usually present in trace amounts in culture filtrates, even in wild-type strains (Maekawa et al. 1984).\\n\\nResults\\n\\nStructure of pcAFT-2\\n\\nPreviously, four cosmid clones containing AKT homologs from the Japanese pear pathotype were isolated (Hatta et al. 2002). One of the cosmids clones, pcAFT-1, has been characterized and four ORFs (AFTI-1, AFTR-1, AFT3-1, AFTSI) were revealed (Hatta et al. 2002; Ito et al. 2004). In this study, a second cosmid clone, pcAFT-2, which contains a 40-kb insert, was reported. This cosmid clone contains two AKT homologs designated AFTR-2 and AFT3-2, which are found at the border of the insert. AFTR-2 and AFT3-2 have 99% and 100% homology to AFTR-1 and AFT3-1, respectively, which are found in pcAFT-1. Upstream of AFTR-2 and AFT3-2 are four new ORFs that are presumed to encode polyketide synthase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 monoxygenase, and oxidoreductase. These ORFs were designated AFT9-1, AFT10-1, AFT11-1, and AFT12-1, respectively. Figure 2A shows the map of pcAFT-2 showing these ORFs.\\n\\nAt the other border of the insert are two transposon-like sequences designated TLS-S4 and TLS-S5. Transposon-like sequences were also found in pcAFT-1 (Hatta et al. 2002). TLS-S4 has high homology to restless transposase of *Nectria haematococca* (Han et al. 2001) and a transposase-like protein of the Ac-type transposon Tto1 of *Fusarium oxysporum* (Okuda et al. 1998). TLS-S5, on the other hand, has high homology to that of the Fot2 transposase identified in *Aspergillus niger* var. *awamori*, which is a member of the Fot1 family (Nysssonen et al. 1996).\\n\\nThe coding sequence of AFT11-1 is around 1764 bp. It encodes a protein consisting of more than 500 amino acids. The sequence of the cDNA compared with that of the genomic DNA had four introns separating the five exons (Fig. 2A). The intron sizes are 62, 42, 53, and 49 basepairs (bp). Two of the introns do not show the typical 5\\u2019[(G/A/T)(A/C/T)G(T/C)] and 3\\u2019[(C/T)AG] splice sites of fungi (Bruchez et al. 1993). BLAST search revealed that AFT11-1 encodes a P450 monoxygenase similar to that of *Aspergillus parasiticus*, *Nostoc punctiforme*, *Arabidopsis thaliana*, and *Musa acuminata*. AFT12-1 consists of a single exon of around 290 amino acids and encodes a protein belonging to the oxidoreductase family (Fig. 2A). It has high homology to the hypothetical proteins of *Gibberella zeae*, *Magnaporthe grisea*, *Aspergillus nidulans*, and *Neuro-\\nspora crassa and to the hydroxypantoate reductases of several bacteria. *AFT9-1* consists of around 3000 amino acids (Fig. 2A). It encodes a polyketide synthase similar to that of *Cochliobolus carbonum* and *Aspergillus terreus*. Based on a BLAST search, the sequence at the terminal portion of *AFT9-1* is fused with sequences homologous to carnitine acyltransferase. The intron site was predicted based on the presence of stop codons within the frame. However, sequencing of the cDNA fragment in the predicted intron site did not reveal any intron so far. Thus, there is a possibility that this ORF may be a pseudogene.\\n\\nThe coding region of *AFT10-1* consists of 1843bp with four introns separating the five exons (Figs. 2A, 3). The first intron appears to be larger than the usual intron size for fungal introns (Deutsche and Long 1999). The intron sizes are at 357, 55, 55, and 52bp, respectively. The ORF codes for around 400 amino acids. A BLAST search showed that it has high homology to the hypothetical proteins of the eukaryotic fungi *Aspergillus nidulans*, *Neurospora crassa*, and *Magnaporthe grisea*; and it is homologous to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase of the eukaryotic fungus *Glomus intraradices*. It also has sequence homology to the isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase of the eukaryotic fungus *Gnomus intraradices*. It also has sequence homology to the isovaleryl-CoA of *Aspergillus nidulans*, which is involved in amino acid oxidation pathways (Kim and Miura 2004; Rodriguez et al. 2004).\\n\\nExpression of the ORFs by RT-PCR amplification\\n\\nTranscription products of *AFT9-1*, *AFT10-1*, *AFT11-1*, and *AFT12-1* in the NAF8 isolate were detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 4). Primer pair C2SR19 and C2SR21 was used to amplify *AFT10-1*. This produced a 1.1-kb fragment from the mRNA of NAF8, which corresponds to the size when the introns are spliced out. Control reactions without reverse transcriptase produced no amplification products, indicating that the fragments were amplified from the cDNA of NAF8. Primer pair C2SR22 and C2SR25 was used to amplify *AFT11-1* and produced a 969-bp fragment from the mRNA of NAF8 and a 1.0-kb fragment from the genomic DNA. Primer pair C2SR26 and C2SR27 was used to amplify *AFT12-1*, producing a 894-bp fragment from both genomic DNA and cDNA of NAF8, indicating an intronless gene. The expression of *AFT9-1* was also investigated using primer pair C2SR10 and C2SR11 where the intron site has been predicted. Several transcripts were produced with a major band the same size as that of the genomic DNA amplicon. Sequencing of the minor bands did not reveal any intron. Thus, the entire *AFT9-1* ORF needs to be further investigated to reveal the function of this gene.\\n\\nDistribution of *AFT9-1*, *AFT10-1*, *AFT11-1*, and *AFT12-1* in *Alternaria alternata*\\n\\nSouthern hybridization was done to determine the distribution of *AFT9-1*, *AFT10-1*, *AFT11-1*, and *AFT12-1* in *Alternaria alternata* isolates. Genomic DNA was digested with *Eco*RI and probed with fragments synthesized from the internal regions of these ORFs. All probes hybridized only to the Japanese pear, strawberry, and tangerine pathotypes (Fig. 5A,C,E,G). These pathotypes are known to have the\\n9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid moiety in their toxin structures (Kohmoto et al. 1993; Nakashima et al. 1985; Nakatsuka et al. 1986). No hybridization was found in the rough lemon, apple, tobacco, tomato, or non-pathogenic isolates (Fig. 5B,D,F,H).\\n\\nFunctional analysis of AFT10-1\\n\\nAmong the ORFs in pcAFT-2, the function of AFT10-1 was analyzed because in preliminary Southern blots using various restriction enzymes it appeared to exist as a single copy in the genome of NAF8 (data not shown). The first disruption vector, p24, was expected to disrupt AFT10-1 by double-crossover homologous recombination. Five hygromycin-resistant mutants, including four double-crossover mutants (44B1, 24.1, 24.4, 24.5) were identified based on Southern hybridization (Fig. 6A). Three fragments (4.9 kb, 845 bp, 3 kb) upon HindIII digestion were expected to hybridize to the ACD probe (Fig. 6B). The presence of the 3-kb native band in all the mutants suggested that AFT10-1 exists in more than one copy in NAF8. The second copy of mutant AFT10-1 was disrupted using the vector pACD2. This vector was also expected to disrupt the gene by double-crossover homologous recombination. Several geneticin-resistant mutants were obtained. These mutants were also resistant to hygromycin, indicating the integration of the vectors. Based on the Southern blot analysis of 24.1.8, derived from 24.1, the second copy was disrupted by a double-crossover homologous recombination event (Fig. 6C\\u2013E).\\n\\nIn pathogenicity tests, disruption of two copies of the gene greatly reduced the number of lesions but did not completely abolish pathogenicity on pear and strawberry leaves (Figs. 7, 8A). The other mutants produced from the first- and second-round disruption events also had reduced pathogenicity. A greater reduction was produced by the second-round mutants compared with that of the first-round mutants (data not shown). Southern hybridization showed the presence of the native band, indicating that AFT10-1 was not totally disrupted. Results, however, confirmed the role of AFT10-1 in the pathogenicity of Alternaria alternata strawberry pathotype. The wild type and the mutants did not differ significantly in their penetration behavior (Fig. 8B), so the decrease in pathogenicity cannot be attributed to a fitness penalty. A decrease in toxin production is more likely to be responsible.\\n\\nToxin productivity was reduced in the mutants compared with that in the wild type (Fig. 8C). AF-toxin I was 55.5% and 97.9% lower in mutant strains 24.1 and 24.1.8, respectively, than in the wild type. AF-toxin II production decreased to almost 70% in 24.1 and up to 90% in 24.1.8. This shows that each copy of AFT10-1 disrupted was functional and contributed to toxin production.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nPreviously, a cosmid genomic library of NAF8 was screened and examined for the distribution of AKT homologs by DNA gel blot analysis. Four cosmid clones were obtained. Structural analysis of pcAFT-2 was reported in this article. The AKT homologs in pcAFT-2 are AFTR-2 and AFT3-2. These genes have corresponding homologs in pcAFT-1, designated AFTR-1 and AFT3-1 (Hatta et al. 2002). AFTR-2 is homologous to AKTR-1 and AKTR-2, which are found in the Japanese pear pathotype. Both AKTR-1 and AKTR-2 have been studied previously and were suggested to be required for the expression of pathway genes of the 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid structure in the Japanese pear, strawberry, and tangerine pathotypes (Tanaka and Tsuge 2000). AFT3-2, on the other hand, is homologous to both AKT3-1 and AKT3-2. Targeting of AKT3-2 produced nonpathogenic, toxin-deficient mutants, indicating its role in toxin biosynthesis. Based on their homology to that of the AKT genes, it is likely that AFTR-2 and AFT3-2 may also be involved in toxin biosynthesis.\\n\\nFour new ORFs that were identified upstream of the AKT homologs encode a polyketide synthase (AFT9-1), an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (AFT10-1), a cytochrome P450 monoxygenase (AFT11-1), and an oxidoreductase (AFT12-1). The presence of RT-PCR products indicates that these ORFs are transcriptionally active. The function of the AFT9-1 mentioned here could not yet be established. It is possible that in Alternaria alternata isolate NAF8 only part of AFT9-1 is functional \\u2013 thus the difficulty in establishing the intron position. Based on the BLAST search, the terminal portion of AFT9-1 is also part of a carnitine acyltransferase, suggesting that it may indeed be a pseudogene. However, the functionality of the AFT9-1 should be further investigated because AF-toxin is a polyketide mol-\\necule, and so a functional PKS should be part of the toxin gene cluster. Distribution analysis also showed that the four ORFs are found only in the Japanese pear, strawberry, and tangerine pathotypes, which share a common 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid structure (Kohmoto et al. 1993; Nakashima et al. 1985; Nakatsuka et al. 1986), suggesting their role in AF-toxin production. The AFT genes in pcAFT-2 appear to be part of the AF-toxin gene cluster. The physical clustering of genes suggests that these genes are acquired through gene transfer (Walton 2000). Because the total set of biosynthetic genes should be transmitted from one species to the other to provide the recipient with a complete biosynthetic pathway, the chance is higher if the genes are clustered (Walton 2000). The A. alternata HST-producing pathotypes have been suggested to evolve as highly specialized parasites with a distinct host via a common biosynthetic pathway (Masunaka et al. 2000). Another important point is that the AFT genes have been found on a 1.05-Mb supernumerary or conditionally dispensable (CD) chromosome (Hatta et al. 2002). Thus it is hypothesized that the ability to produce HST in Alternaria may have been due to transfer of a CD chromosome (Ito et al. 2004). A CD chromosome is also associated with the toxin phenotype in Alternaria alternata apple pathotype (Johnson et al. 2001).\\n\\nAFT10-1 encodes an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Generally, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is involved in the first step in $\\\\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids. This enzyme has an important role in the generation of acetyl-CoA, which is a substrate for the biosynthesis of natural products and a central metabolite in a variety of important physiological processes (Qiu et al. 1999). Disruption of two copies of AFT10-1 resulted in highly reduced pathogenicity on both strawberry and pear leaves, indicating that this gene plays a role in pathogenicity. Because homologs of this gene are found only in the Japanese pear, strawberry, and tangerine pathotypes, this enzyme must be involved in the formation of 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid.\\nstructure (Kohmoto et al. 1993; Nakashima et al. 1985; Nakatsuka et al. 1986), which is shared by these pathotypes. Several other genes previously identified in the toxin cluster were also unique to the three pathotypes (Hatta et al. 2002; Masunaka et al. 2000; Tanaka and Tsuge 2000; Tanaka et al. 1999), although there are also other genes in the cluster that are pathotype-specific (Ito et al. 2004). The ability of the double copy mutant to cause disease symptoms after disruption of two copies of the gene indicates that there is still a functional copy of the gene. Based on preliminary Southern blot analysis, AFT10-1 exists as a single-copy gene in the NAF8 isolate. However, the gene may exist as three copies; the adjacent regions of the gene may be conserved within the genome so the banding patterns were initially thought to be that of a single copy gene. Also, based on the results, all three copies may be functional. Thus, disruption of two copies is not enough for total loss in pathogenicity. Results, however, showed that each copy of the gene that was disrupted contributed significantly to toxin production and the pathogenicity of the organism, although it cannot be ascertained yet which copy contributes the most. Production of a null mutant is still ongoing. This article, therefore, is the first report on the disruption of a multicopy gene involved in the AF-toxin gene cluster. It is also interesting to note that although the previous gene-targeting experiments on AFT1-1 and AFT3-1 produced nonpathogenic and toxin-deficient mutants through loss of a 1.05-Mb chromosome.\\n\\nFig. 6.

The same gene-targeting strategy was used in this experiment. However, the difference may be in the position of the genes involved in the chromosome and on the number of copies of the genes. The mechanism underlying the loss of the 1.05-Mb chromosome, however, is still unknown; we therefore cannot yet explain why site-directed gene targeting was possible here without loss of the 1.05-Mb chromosome.\\n\\nThe presence of transcripts and their distribution in the 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid-producing isolates of *Alternaria alternata* suggests that *AFT10-1, AFT11-1, AFT10-1*, and *AFT12-1* are involved in AF-toxin production and the pathogenicity of the organism. The sequence similarity of *AFTR-2* and *AFT3-2* with that of the *AKT* genes suggests that they may be involved in the formation of the 9,10-epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid structure (Kohmoto et al. 1993; Nakashima et al. 1985; Nakatsuka et al. 1986). The results of this study provide additional support for the clustering of genes involved in AF-toxin biosynthesis. It also confirms the involvement of *AFT10-1* in toxin production and pathogenicity of NAF8 isolate of *Alternaria alternata*. However, the other genes still need to be characterized to determine their respective roles in the toxin cluster.\\nThe role of host-specific toxins in saprophytic pathogens.

Since the use of bones has, however, become general, the turnip crop has been, in many instances, ten-fold, and in few less than four or five-fold its former bulk. All the succeeding crops of grain and seeds have been amazingly increased, and, upon the four or five-shift system, there is no doubt the land will go on progressively improving, requiring a less quantity of bones annually, from its increased fertility and power.\\\"\\n\\nOn light loams, the returns to the Doncaster Committee give bones a preference to farm-yard dung. And we learn that, upon the calcareous soil of the Yorkshire Wolds, heavy crops of turnips have been raised from 16 bushels per acre of bones, while in the same field, and under similar circumstances, but manured from the farm-yard at the rate of from 8 to 10 tons per acre, the turnips have been of the most inferior description.\\n\\nOn peat soils, if previously drained and laid dry, their advantages are reported to be so striking, that from fifteen to twenty bushels of dust per acre, drilled, have been also found to very far surpass the ordinary dressing of stable-dung, and even of lime and pigeons' dung.\\n\\nOn gravels, the reports are meagre and contradictory, though perhaps reconcilable in principle, as it has been justly observed, that \\\"a gravelly soil may embrace every variety of texture and quality, from the light dry sand to the water-logged yellow clay\\u2014preserving in each the necessary admixture of stones and grit.\\\" To wet gravel, their application has been found decidedly unfavourable.\\n\\n**ANALYSIS.**\\n\\nAn examination of the component parts of soils, and of the power of bones, when applied to them as manure, would go far to explain the irregularity of their different effects upon various kinds of soil. Bone is known to consist of about equal parts of earthy and animal matter; the former chiefly composed of gypsum\\u2014which is of so indestructible a nature as to have been termed, by early chemists, the \\\"earth of bones\\\"\\u2014and a small portion of carbonate of lime; from which we may conclude that probably half the weight of bones is in the greater part consumed by plants as direct nourishment in their state of growth, and that the remainder is more gradually absorbed by the soil, as well also as by the plants; for lime, though in small amount, is always present, in greater or less quantity, in all vegetable substances.\\n\\n\\\"The quantity of earthy matter varies according to the age of the animal; and, in like manner, the quantity of animal matter varies also in proportion to the condition of the animal. In the best kinds of bones for manure, viz., those from fat young animals, perhaps the following proportions may give an approximation to the relative quantities of each in 100 parts:\\u2014\\n\\n| Component             | Quantity |\\n|-----------------------|----------|\\n| Earthy and saline matter | 40 parts |\\n| Cartilage and jelly    | 40 parts |\\n| Fatty matter           | 20 parts |\\n\\nThe soft parts thus form, in the best bone, about sixty, and upon an average, perhaps, amount to fifty per cent., which are almost entirely constituted of the same elements of plants, and all of them, sooner or later, liable to be dissolved and absorbed by the roots. The cartilage, indeed, when the bones have been buried in a dry situation, is very indestructible; but when exposed to the action of air, water, soil, and vegetation, will probably pass into the state of jelly, and be dissolved, or otherwise decomposed,\\n\\n* Doncaster Report, p. 8.\", \"source\": \"olmocr\", \"added\": \"2025-03-05\", \"created\": \"2025-03-05\", \"metadata\": {\"Source-File\": \"tests/gnarly_pdfs/small_page_size.pdf\", \"olmocr-version\": \"0.1.59\", \"pdf-total-pages\": 1, \"total-input-tokens\": 5373, \"total-output-tokens\": 829, \"total-fallback-pages\": 0}, \"attributes\": {\"pdf_page_numbers\": [[0, 3501, 1]]}}\n"
